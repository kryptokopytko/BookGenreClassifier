Transcriber’s Note: Some of the kanji characters in this book appear
to have no modern equivalent and a close but not identical character--a
“best guess”--has been substituted. These are shown e.g. {蹄}.

PREFACE


The following texts are exact transliterations of the _Kana yomi_ of
the Manyôshiu, and of the _yomi_ of the mixed Japanese script of the
Taketori Monogatari, the Preface to the Kokinwakashiu, and Takasago,
according to the system devised by Sir Ernest Satow and adopted by
Professor Chamberlain.

The translations of the texts are given in a companion volume, where
full explanatory introductions and notes will be found.

The following abbreviations are employed: (K.) Professor Chamberlain’s
translation of the Kojiki; (N.) Dr. Aston’s translation of the Nihongi;
(Fl.) Professor Florenz’s part translation of the Nihongi; (Br.)
Captain Brinkley’s Japanese-English Dictionary; (I.) Kotoba no Izumi;
(T.A.S.J.) Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan.

The texts contained in the present volume are:--

1. The _nagauta_ or _chôka_ (long lays) of the Manyôshiu, the earliest
of the Japanese Anthologies, compiled about 760 A.D., with their
_kaheshi uta_ or _hanka_ (envoys). The text used is that of Kamochi
Masazumi in his magnificent edition, Manyôshiu Kogi, the Ancient
Meaning of the Manyôshiu, written during the first half of the
nineteenth century but published in 1879.

2. The Taketori Monogatari, Story of the Old Wicker-worker. The text
used is that of Tanaka Daishiu, published about 1838.

3. The Preface of Ki no Tsurayuki to his famous Anthology--the second
of the old anthologies--known as Kokinwakashiu--Anthology of Japanese
Verse Old and New--written about 922 A.D. The text is that of Kaneko
Genshin in his edition of 1903.

4. The _utahi_ of Takasago, perhaps the earliest of the medieval
miracle-plays (Nô), composed in the fifteenth century. The text used is
that of the Yôkyoku Tsûge, edited by Ohowada Kenjiu, and published by
the Hakubunkwan in 22 Meiji (1889).

Appended to 1. are some _tanka_ from the Kokinshiu and the Hyakunin
Isshiu (1214 A.D.), and in the volume of translations examples of
_hokku_ or the half-stanza, the so-called Japanese epigram, are given
with their translations.

A careful perusal, twice or thrice repeated, of the short grammar
and the following section on the Language of the Manyôshiu comprised
in the Introduction, with the aid of the List of Makura Kotoba, the
Glossary, and the companion volume of translations, will meet nearly
all the difficulties of the _romanized_ texts, and enable the reader to
appreciate sufficiently the charm of these ancient lays, of which the
more unique elements escape translation.

EMENDATIONS


For the necessity of these emendations I am wholly responsible.

In a few of the earlier lays the lines are not properly indented.
In one or two cases the category is wrongly printed as part of the
_dai_--as under Lay 1.

In a very few instances a capital letter is mistakenly used--thus
_Tsuma_ for _tsuma_.

In the following instances it is better to print place-names with
initial capital--Kashihara, Ohotsu, Shirokane, Chitose, Kagu, Katsu,
Tagi, Kamu, Yuki.

Where _eta_ is found it should be read _eba_.

Some few cases of _u_ for _a_, _u_ for _n_, _u_ for _i_, _a_ for
_o_, _e_ for _i_, or the reverse, occur--they are quite obvious.
Occasionally words are joined which on the whole are better separated,
as _Kata nashi_, or the reverse.

INTRODUCTION


SHORT GRAMMAR OF OLD JAPANESE

The pronunciation of Old Japanese follows a very simple scheme. There
are the five vowels, _a_, _e_, _i_, _o_, _u_, and no diphthongs, and
the following consonants and digraphs _b_, _ch_, _d_, _dz_, _f_, _g_,
_h_, _j_, _k_, _m_, _n_, _r_, _s_, _sh_, _t_, _ts_, _w_, _y_, _z_,
_zh_. The syllables are all open, and consist of

(1) The five vowels.

(2) _b_, _k_, _m_, _n_, _r_, followed by all the vowels.

(3) _s_, _y_, _z_, followed by _a_, _e_, _o_, _u_.

(4) _h_, _w_, followed by _a_, _e_, _i_, _o_.

(5) _d_, _t_, followed by _a_, _e_, _o_.

(6) _f_, followed by _i_, _u_.

(7) _ch_, _j_, _sh_, _zh_, followed by _i_.

(8) _ts_, _dz_, followed by _u_.

Sixty-four open syllables in all, out of 105 possible ones, of which
and their various agglutinations the whole language is made up.

The vowels are pronounced as in Italian, _a_ being the accented _a_,
_e_ and _o_ the open sounds. The vowel _u_ is English _u_ in _put_,
never as in _rut_ or _lute_. The vowels _a_, _e_, _o_ are half-long,
_i_ and _u_ are shorter, and _u_ shortest of all. Value is given
to each syllable, subject as above, with scarcely any ictus (as in
French), but the last syllable of a word, especially in _u_, is always
weakest, and the penultimate rather the strongest.

The consonants are pronounced as in English, _h_ well aspirated, but
rather forward, even between vowels, _z_ as in _zany_, _zh_ as the _s_
in _pleasure_, _f_ may have descended from an original _p_, with _h_
and _w_.

The scheme, according to that of the _Oxford Dictionary_, would be--

    a   a
    e   e
    i   i
    o   o
    u   u
    b   b
    ch  tʃ
    d   d
    dz  dz
    f   f
    g   g
    h   h
    j   dʒ
    k   k
    m   m
    n   n
    r   r
    s   s
    sh  ʃ
    t   t
    ts  ts
    w   w
    y   y
    z   z
    zh  ʒ

The Chinese and Japanese languages differ from Aryan and Semitic forms
of speech in the total absence of all concords dependent upon number,
person, case, and gender, in the like default of relative words, and
(from Aryan speech) in the absence of _narratio obliqua_. They further
differ in the almost complete absence of any morphological moods or
tenses. Chinese has, broadly speaking, no accidence at all; the grammar
is a syntax teaching the right order and use of vocables (used as
words), double vocables (constituting words), and the few form-words
(empty words the Chinese call them) which serve as variously connective
particles. In Japanese there is a very scanty accidence of the few
adjectives the language possesses, and a more complete one of the verb;
but the verbal forms are all (with an exception or two) resolvable
into locutions, more or less agglutinated, scarcely constituting true
inflexions. Hence, morphologically, even in Japanese there is neither
mood nor tense, but there is an approach to both of the highest value
to the language, giving it, in conjunction with a goodly number of
particles, an articulation and plasticity wanting to Chinese. From the
above considerations it will be readily understood that the power of
expression even in Japanese is far inferior to that of Western speech.
The imagery is, of necessity, extremely limited in range and flat in
tone. It seems to me, however, of greater range and higher quality than
in Chinese. But neither Chinese nor Japanese possesses a tithe of the
capacity of Aryan and Semitic languages to express human thought and
feeling, and describe the works of man or the appearances of nature.

Ὦ δῖος αἰθήρ, &c., thought and words, are absolutely unintelligible to
the whole Far East.

Nevertheless the poetry of the two great Far Eastern languages has its
charm, especially the early poetry of Japan, but that charm, depending
as it does largely upon suggestiveness rather than definite statement,
and upon characteristic form and decoration rather than content, can
only be felt by those who are able to read the texts. The Japanese
texts, apart from the labour of decipherment, in themselves present no
difficulty, once their simple grammar and construction understood, and
in their romanized dress, with the brief grammar that is now subjoined,
and the other aids offered in the present volume and its accompanying
volume of translations are, it is hoped, made accessible to the
English reader who cannot give several years to the acquisition of
the complicated scripts which Dai Nippon has taken over, by necessity
rather than choice, from the Middle Kingdom.

The following sketch of the grammar of Old Japanese is intended merely
to elucidate the texts, principally those of the Manyôshiu and the
Taketori.[1] By Old Japanese is meant the unsinicized language of the
Kojiki and Nihongi (as read _japonicé_) and particularly of the _uta_
quoted in those works, of the _norito_ or rituals, and of the texts
above mentioned. There are no texts illustrating earlier stages of the
language, and all etymologies are doubtful, both on that account and
because the elements of Old Japanese are mere agglutinations (more or
less contracted) of only sixty-four open syllables.

Japanese (by which expression Old Japanese is here always intended)
has no affinity with Chinese, a language consisting of disconnected
elements (simple or compound), for in it agglutination has to some
extent contracted into inflexion or quasi-inflexion, and it possesses
in addition a large number of particles which give it a plasticity
not found in Chinese. In my opinion, had the development of Japanese
not been arrested by Chinese influences about the middle of the first
millennium, it might have won a far higher place than it occupies in
the hierarchy of human speech.

This agglutinative inflexion is practically confined to the verb,
and--to a slight extent--to nouns adjective, simple or verbalized. What
may be called the stem of the verb shows a pure vocalic inflexion in
_a_, _e_, _i_, _o_ or _u_. The stem in _u_ is the form usually found in
native and foreign dictionaries--in Lemaréchal’s it is the stem in _e_
or _i_. To the stem the various locutions are suffixed to construct the
forms representing, logically, moods and tenses as well as negative,
causative, and potential-passive ‘voices’.

The stems in _e_, _i_ and _o_ are used as imperatives; _koge_, row!,
_mi_, look!, _ko_ come!, often with addition of the vocative particle
_yo_ (or _ro_)--_miyo_, _koyo_. They are also used as ‘indefinite’
(Chamberlain) forms, mood and tense being determined by that of the
principal verb in the sentence. Before proceeding further it is well
to state that in the regular Japanese sentence the principal verb is
always at the end, the object (if expressed) in the middle, and the
subject (if expressed) at the beginning of the sentence, while words
of qualification precede the words qualified. In poetry however,
especially in the Manyôshiu, inversions are common.

All syllables in Japanese are open, and the terminal syllables of the
stems are the consonants _b_, _f_, _g_, _k_, _m_, _n_, _r_, _s_, the
digraph _ts_, _w_, _y_, and _z_ followed by the vowels _a_, _e_, _i_,
_o_, _u_ (also _u_ without consonant as in _suu_, _e_ stem _suwe_,
to place). Before _i_ _ts_ becomes _ch_, and before _e_ and _a_ _t_,
before _i_ _s_ becomes _sh_ and _z_ _zh_; before every vowel except _u_
_f_ becomes _h_. All verbs have the stem in _u_, most verbs have also
the stem in _a_ and _i_, some have also the stem in _e_ only, some in
_i_ only. There are a very few irregular verbs. The following list of
verbs and their stems will illustrate the above remarks:--

    _yerabu_, _yerabi_, _yerabe_, _yeraba_      choose
    _omofu_, _omohi_, _omohe_, _omoha_          think
    _kogu_, _kogi_, _koge_, _koga_              row
    _sugu_, _sugi_                              pass
    _fuku_, _fuki_, _fuke_, _fuka_              blow
    _tomu_, _tome_                              stop
    _tsukanu_, _tsukane_                        bind
    _toru_, _tori_, _tore_, _tora_              take
    _watasu_, _watashi_, _watase_, _watasa_     pass over
    _tatsu_, _tachi_, _tate_, _tata_            stand
    _su[w]u_, _suwe_                            place
    _suyu_, _suye_                              be rancid
    _sufu_, _suhe_                              suck
    _mazu_, _mazhi_, _maze_, _maza_             mix
    _miru_, _mi_ (_mire_)                       see
    _suru_, _shi_, _se_ (_sure_)                do
    _kuru_, _ki_, _ko_, _kure_, _ke_, _kere_    come
    [_wu_] _woru_, _wi_, _wiru_, _wore_, _wora_ be in, at

The Japanese verb has neither number nor person, the forms that follow
therefore are indefinite as to number and person. The locutions--or
more strictly the complements that with the stem make up the
locution--are given below as suffixed to the stem.

Two moods may be distinguished. One I call Independent, in which form
the verb is unconnected with any other verb, the other Dependent, in
which the verb is connected with some verb in the Independent mood.[2]
Mr. Chamberlain calls them Indicative and Oblique respectively.

There are in each mood three forms or quasi-tenses--a present,
temporally indefinite; a past denoting action or state completed at or
before the present or some indicated past time; and a future denoting
action, &c., that may or will be completed at a future (or past-future)
time. Each of these tenses in the Independent mood has a predicative
or simpler form and a relative form--as relating to some noun. It is
the simpler form, identical with the stem in _u_, which is found in the
dictionaries (in Lemaréchal’s the stem in _a_, _i_, or _e_ is found).
The relative form ends in _uru_ (modern _iru_ or _eru_). Thus _toki
sugu_, time passes; _suguru toki_, tempus quod fugit (some verbs in
_uru_ are transitive as _tatsu_, stand, _tatsuru_, make stand, set
up). Only those verbs which have _e_ or _i_ stems throughout appear to
possess this relative form;[3] in verbs with _i_ and _a_ stems this
morphological distinction does not exist.

The Past has four forms, each double (P. predicative, R. relative).

(1) P. _ki_, R. _-shi_.

(2) P. _tari_ (_te-ari_), R. _-taru_ (_te-aru_).

(3) P. _-tariki_, R. _-tarishi_ (composed of (2) and (1)).

(4) P. _-nu_, R. _-nuru_.

[_ki_ (_kuru_) = come (cp. Ital. _vien fatto_); _shi_ (_suru_) = do;
_te_ = stem of _tsu_, _tsuru_, continue; _ari_ is an irr. P. form of
_aru_, be; _nu_ is an old verb = be.] In _i a_ verbs there is a past in
P. _-eri_, R. _-eru_ (see below).

The Future is formed by suffixing _mu_ (or _namu_) to stem or _naramu_
(_ni [nu] aramu [aru]_) to R. form if any.

SCHEMATIC EXAMPLES.

    _kogu_, row (with oars or sculls).

    Stems.      Present.          Past.               Future.
    _kogu_     _kogu_, P. & R.   _kogiki_, P.        _kogamu_, P.
    _kogi_                       _kogishi_, R.      (_koginamu_)
    _koga_                       _kogitari_, P.      _kogu naramu_
                                 _kogitaru_, R.     [_tomuru naramu_, R.]
                                 _kogitariki_, P.
                                 _kogitarishi_, R.
                                 _koginu_, P.
                                 _koginuru_, R.
                                 _kogeri_, P.
                                 _kogeru_, R.

_tomu_, stop, and _sugu_, pass, are conjugated like _kogu_, except that
_tomu_ replaces _i_ and _a_ of _kogu_ forms by _e_, and _sugu_ by _i_.

In the Dependent mood the forms are constructed with the help of _-ba_
(the particle _ha_, voiced). _Shikaba_ (etym. of _shika_?), _tareba_,
_taraba_ (_te areba_, _-araba_), _naba_ (_nu_) and _naraba_ (_ni
araba_).

SCHEMATIC EXAMPLES.

    _kogeba_,                            as, since, when, &c., row.

    _kogaba_, _koginaba_, _koginaraba_,  if row.

    _kogishikaba_, _kogitareba_,         as, since, when &c., rowed.

    _kogitaraba_, _kogishi naraba_,      if rowed.

Of _tomu_, _sugu_, the Dependent Mood is similarly conjugated
preserving the _e_ and _i_ vowels, and for _tomeba_ using _tomureba_
for _tomaba_ _tomeba_, for _sugiba_ _sugureba_, for _sugaba_ _sugiba_.

The negative voice (there are no negative words = not, no, none). The
Present Independent is formed by changing the _-mu_ of future into
_-zu_ or _-zaru_ (_zu aru_), P. and _-nu_, R. Thus _kogu_ (_kogamu_),
_kogazu_, _kogazaru_, _koganu_; _sugu_, _sugimu_, _sugizu_, &c.

In the past _-zu_ becomes _zariki_, P., and _-zarishi_, R.; in the
future _-zaramu_ or _-zhi_, P. and R. (_kogazaramu_, _kogazhi_).

There is a second future with sense of obligation exemplified as
follows:--_kogu_ (not _koga_) _-mazhiku_ (indefinite), _-mazhi_, P.,
_-mazhiki_, R., _-mazhikariki_, P., past fut. _-mazhikarishi_, R.,
past fut. _-mazhikereba_, conditional, when as, &c., and _-mazhikuba_,
hypothetical, if, &c.

In the Dependent Mood we have:--

    _koganeba_, _kogazareba_,              as, when, &c., not-row.

    _kogazuba_,                            if not-row.

    _kogazarishikaba_,                     as, when, &c., not-rowed.

    _kogazariseba_, _kogazarishi naraba_,  if not-rowed.

The Imperatives are:--

_Kogazare_ (_kogazu are_); _kogu nakare_ (_naku are_); _koguna_, _kogu
koto nakare_ (row-thing do-not), _na kogi so_, _yume kogu na_ (emphatic
imperative). But _na_ with _i_ or _e_ stem is an affirmative imperative
_kogi na_, do row!

There is another past in _tsu_[4], _tsuru_ as _kogitsu_, _kogitsuru_,
and a continuative form in _tsutsu_, _kogitsutsu_, while rowing.
Also a form in _-keri_, P. and _-keru_, R. with a dependent _-kereba_
as _kogikeru_, _kogikereba_. This _keri_ form seems equivalent to a
perfect definite, have rowed. Its etymology must be _ki -ari_; of _tsu_
the stem would be _te_, which added to stem in _i_ or _e_ makes forms
such as _kogite_, _tomete_, which are continuative indefinites almost
equal to ‘whilst’, _kogite_, _yuku_, whilst-row-go, i.e. row to (a
place).

The negative form of _-te_ is _-de_, _kogade_, or _-zu_, _-zu ni_, _-zu
shite_, as _kogazu_, not-row, _kogazu ni_, in, or by not-row, _kogazu
shite_, not-row-do, all meaning essentially whilst-not-row.

The particles _mo_, too, _to mo_, that too (with variant _domo_)
_keredomo_ (_ki-ari-to-mo_), following or suffixed to verb-forms, give
a concessive force, although, even though, &c., _beku_, with sense of
must, can, will, ought, is suffixed to the _u_ stem, thus _kogubeku_ is
must, or ought to row, or will row--the forms of _beku_ are _beshi_,
P.; _beki_, R.; _bemi_, _bekariki_, P.; _-shi_, R.; _bekereba_,
_bekuba_, _bekarazu_, &c.; _beku mazhiku_ almost = _bekarazu_.

Causative verbs (often used as transitives or as honour-forms) are
easily recognized. Thus _nageku_, sigh, lament, _nagekasu_; or forms
derived from _su_ (_suru_), do, are added--_shimuru_, _seshimuru_,
_sasuru_. Thus _yaku_, burn, _yakasu_, _yakashimuru_; _suru_ (_se_),
do, _sesasuru_, make-do.

_Nu_ (_ni_) is an old verb ‘be’. _Ni_ + _aru_ = _naru_, become, be
at, of, in. The future _namu_ is a common auxiliary suffix. _Namu_
may become _namashi_, by composition with _mashi_, more, a suffixed
optative particle. Another optative is formed by adding the slight
interrogative particle _ya_ to the form in _-aba_ as _yukabaya_, should
like to go; sometimes the future form is in _-ramu_ (_aramu_?) added
to the _u_-stem, as _aruramu_ for _aramu_, _kofuramu_ for _kohamu_
(_kohimu_), will love. _Aru_, be, is peculiar in that its P.-form is
_ari_ not _aru_.

The verb _miru_, see, keeps the _mi_ throughout, _miru_, _miki_,
_mishi_, _mimu_, _miba_, _mitsu_ (past), _mizu_, _minu_, _mizhi_,
_mide_, &c.; but _mireba_, _miredomo_, _miru_ or _miheku_, &c. So
_hi(ru)_, dry, _i(ru)_, shoot, _(w)i(ru)_, be in or at, _ki(ru)_, wear
_ni(ru)_, be like, _ni(ru)_, boil. See Chamberlain, p. 66. By adding
_u_, _uru_ (get) with or without _aru_ (be) verbs passive and potential
are obtained. Thus _yaku_ (burn) + _ari_ + _uru_ = _yakaruru_, so
we have _homeraruru_ (_homu_, praise), _sugiraruru_ (_sugu_, pass),
_miraruru_ (_miru_, see). Or we have _miyuru_, see-get = seem, so
_omoyuru_, _omoheru_ (from _omofu_, think), or _omoharuru_ (see
Glossary, _omofu_, &c.), _iheru_ (_ihi-uru_), is said, &c. From _aru_
(be) lengthened to _arafu_, we get _araharu_, _araharuru_, _arahaseru_,
be manifest or make manifest.

Other passive-like forms are _iyu_ (_i_), shot, _oyu_ (_oi_), grown
old, _omohoyu_ (_omofu_), thought. There is a form in _-aku_, thus
_ifu_, say, _ihaku_--even the future has it, _kakemu_, will utter,
_kakemaku_, and the past _omoheraku_, the morphological origin of which
is unknown. It seems to give a substantival character to the verb;
_ihaku_, the saying (is); _omoheraku_, what was thought (is): also a
frequentative (rare) in _mi_, _wemi-mi, wemazu mo_, smiling and not
smiling.

Under _koso_ will be found the verbal forms used with that particle.

Of the verb _su_ _suru_, do, the principal forms are:--

Independent Mood.

    _shi_, _su_, _suru_, (_koso_) _sure_.
    _seri_, _seru_ (_koso_), _sere_.
    _shiki_, _seshi_ (_koso_), _seshika_.
    _shitari_, &c., _shitariki_, &c.
    _shitsu_, _shitsuru_ (_koso_), _shitsure_.
    _semu_, _suramu_ (_koso_), _-e_, _-e_.
    _shitaramu_, _shitsuramu_, &c.

Dependent Mood.

    _sureba_, _seshikaba_, _shitareba_.
    _seba_, _senaba_, _shitaraba_.
    _suredo_ (_mo_).
    _suru mo_, _shite mo_.
    _seshikado_, _shitaredo_, _seshi_ (_mo_).
    _sebaya_.
    _shitsutsu_, &c.

Negative Voice.

    _sezu_, _senu_ (_koso_) _sene_.
    _sezhi_, _sezaru_, and derived forms.
    _sezuba_, _senedo_.
    _sezare_, _suna_, _na se so_, &c.

Of the verb _ku_ _kuru_, come, the principal forms are:--

Independent Mood.

    _ki_, _ku_, _kuru_, _kure_.
    _kishi_, _koshi_ (_kiki_ not found), _kishika_, _koshika_.
    _kitari_, &c., _kitariki_, &c.
    _kinu_, _kinuru_, &c., _kitsu_, _kitsuru_, &c.
    _komu_, _kuramu_, _kinamu_, &c.
    _koyo_.
    _kubeku_.

Dependent Mood.

    _kureba_, _kishikaba_, &c.
    _koba_, _kinaba_.
    _kuredo_ (_mo_), &c.
    _kobaya_.
    _kitsutsu_.
    _kite_.

Negative Voice.

    _kozu_, _konu_, &c.
    _kozhi_.
    _kozareba_.
    _koneba_.
    _kozare_.
    _kuna_.
    _kuruna_.
    _na ko so_.

The other forms of _kuru_ are easily formed from those of _suru_,
replacing _se_ and _su_ by _ko_ and _ku_.

There are not many true adjectives. Such have a sort of positional
inflexion--a predicative form in _-shi_, _akashi_, be red, a form used
chiefly with verbs (but also indefinitely) in _-ku_, _akaku naru_,
become red, and a form in _-ki_, used mainly with nouns, _akaki mono_,
red thing. There is also a form in _-mu_, _-mi_, which has a verbal
force denoting a state or condition.

Adjectives may also be verbalized by the addition of _aru_, be, and
many of its forms with obvious contractions.

Lastly, adjectival expressions are formed by adding _naru_, be or
become, to adjectival stems _yaharaka_, _yaharaka-naru_, soft, gentle.

Nouns substantive (and pronouns) are absolutely devoid of gender or
case, and only occasionally have a plural suffix _ra_ or _tachi_ or
_nodo_ or _domo_.

Pronouns are few, and--the personal pronouns especially--are little
used, the subject of the verb being generally unexpressed and left to
be gathered from the context.

    First person  _a_, _wa_, _are_, _ware_, _waga_, _wago-_, _wagi-_.

    Second person _na_, _namuji_, _nase_, _imashi_, _imo_.

    Third person  _a_, _are_, _kare_ (_is_, _ille_, Aston).
                  _so_, _sore_       (_iste_, Aston).
                  _ko_, _kore_       (_hic_, Aston).

Interrogative Pronouns.

    _Ta_, _tare_,     who?
    _na_, _nani_,     what?
    _izure_, _izu_,   which, what?
    _ika_,            what manner? ποῖος.
    _iku_,            what number? &c., πόσος.

Other pronouns are _shi_, _onore_, _mi_, self, _onore_ and _mi_, often
I _myself_, or I, _ono-ono_, every, _mina_, all. Other pronominal
forms, chiefly indefinite, are explained in the glossary.

Only the principal particles need here be noticed. Others are explained
in the glossary. The following are of special importance, and are found
mainly in connexion with nouns as postpositions. They are _wa_ (_ha_),
_ga_, _no_, _ni_, _he_ (_e_, _ye_) and _wo_.

_ha_ (_wa_, _ba_) isolates and emphasizes the noun rather as apart
from the verb--_chichi haha ha, uwe-samukaramu_, father and mother,
_they_ will be hungry and cold; _kono toki ha, ika ni shitsutsuka_,
this time _then_ while doing what. This emphatic force explains its
occurrence after verbs and sentences or clauses--_ihazu-ba_, not say
indeed = should we not say …; _Yamato ni ha_, it is in Yamato that …;
_yuki furu yo ha_, a night indeed on which snow falls: _a wo koso se to
ha_, it is I indeed whom (you should call) husband.

_ga_ is a possessive particle, _wa-ga (warega) ohokimi_, my great
lord; _Wazami ga hara_, plain of Wazami. It may be used before verbs,
_tori ga naku_, the bird cries; or after, _nabiku ga gotoku_, like
bending before. Sometimes it resembles _ha_ _kimi ga agari-ki-masamu_,
my lord, he will embark.

_tsu_ is possessive, _amatsu kami_, gods of heaven, _kuni tsu kami_,
gods of the land. It seems to follow names of things only.

_no_ (originally _nu_, be?) is used as a genitive particle, like ‘of’.
It is more general than _ga_, which is special; _no_ sometimes almost
equals _ha_ (_wa_). _Mi-torashi no adzusa no yumi no hazu no oto_,
sound of the notch of the bow of whitewood of his royal grasp; _Uchi
no ohonu_, the great moor of _Uchi_. This particle may connect other
words than nouns, _ari no kotogoto_, all one has, or, there is (_ari_);
_miru no goto_, like _miru_ (seaweed); _ame tsuchi no wakareshi
toki_, heaven--earth’s separated time (time of separation of heaven
and earth). This connexion by _no_ of parts of a sentence--often wide
apart--other than nouns must be carefully kept in mind. Thus read _hito
no [mono wo omofu]_, a man’s thinking of things (regretfully): not
_[hito no mono] wo omofu_, to think of a man-thing (or man’s things,
&c.)[5].

_ni_ (perhaps a stem of _nu_, be) = in, to, at, for, with, by, on,
near; _Yamato ni_, in Yamato; _toki ni_, at time = when; _miya ni
amori_, descend from heaven to the palace; _te ni tori_, take in the
hand; _ashita ni_, on the morrow; _asagari ni tatasu_, start for
morning-hunt; _tokoro ni yuku_, go to a place; also adverbially,
_yasukaranaku ni_, in a not-restful way; _aya ni_, strangely;
_kogi-yuku ni_, in or while rowing on; _tokoshihe ni_, everlastingly.
_Ni_ sometimes transfers the action of a causative or transitive verb
to the noun it follows.

_wo_, after a noun indicates it as object of action or, sometimes, as
subject of state or condition; _unasaka wo sugite_, passing beyond
bounds of ocean; _miyako wo tohomi_, _miyako_ (as to), be distant
(Aston); _mikado wo sadame_, settle on a site for a palace; _kuni wo
sadame_, terram debellare. In this sense _wo_ is often omitted, _oi
mo sezu_, old-age even not-doing = never growing old. It may follow
a verb as an emphatic particle, or even a noun as such, but in these
cases there is probably an ellipsis of _suru_ (do) _omofu_, (think) or
the like, or again it may follow a particle, _to bakari_, &c. (Aston).
Where it appears to have an adversative force there is probably
ellipsis of _omoheba_, _omohite_, &c. _Wo ba_ = _wo ha_, and singles
out the noun as specially emphasized. _Wo_ sometimes almost equals _ni_.

_he_ (lit. quarter, direction, locality, tract in space or time) =
towards (_ni_ = to). Rare in the texts in this volume, _yori_ (lit.
approach, or be close to, or stop at), shortened often to _yo_, _yu_,
means by extension ‘from’--in later language also ‘than’.

_ya_, _yo_, is a vocative or exclamative interjection.

_to_, that, is a connective particle = and, also after a phrase marks
it as quotative; _toko miya to sadame_, establish as an everlasting
shrine (or palace), _sugimu to omoheba_, thinking (intending) that it
should outlast. _Hikohoshi ha Tanabata tsu me to_, Hikohoshi and the
Weaving Woman; _se to ha norame_ (see under _ha_); _kamusabu to_, in
a divinely awful manner; _hito wo yahase to … kuni wo osame to …
makitamaheba_, as he was charged to subdue the people and pacify the
land (people subdue that … land pacify that--as he was charged with).
The different uses of _to_ can always be made out by taking it as
_that_.

Other particles are:--

_ya_, slight dubitative and interrogative, also exclamative. With
negative it gives an affirmative sense.

_ka_, stronger than _ya_.

_ya_ _ka_ with _ha_ (_yaha_ _kaha_) imply a certainty.

_ka mo_, final interjectional expression = is it not even so? i.e.
emphatically or admiringly, it is so!

_kana_ (_gana_, _mo gana_), final interjection of emotion suited to
what precedes.

_mo_, also, too, even; _mo … mo_, both … and.

_so_ (_zo_) perhaps, _sore_, this! emphasizes the preceding word.

_koso_ (_ko[re], so[re]_) this-that (Aston), more emphatic than _so_
(_zo_), commonly precedes the verb, expressed or understood. There is a
quasi-conjugation with _koso_--

_koso koge_;

_koso kogere_;

_koso kogishika_,--_kogitare_,--_kogitarishika_,--_koginure_,--
_kogitsure_,--_kogame_,--_koginame_,--_kogurame,_ &c.

_a wo koso se to ha norame_--in prose, _a wo se to ha koso norame_,
_do_ call me husband!

_namu_ (_nan_) is very like _koso_, but less emphatic.

_goto_ = _gotoku_, like also sometimes _kotogotoku_, generally, all;
_goto ni_ (after the noun), every, each.

_dani_, even, at all events; _sura_, even (unexpected); _sahe_, even
(additional).

_shi_, _nomi_, _bakari_, just, only, precisely--in ascending degree
of certainty. All of these, especially _shi_, are often not more than
slightly emphatic expletives.

_made_, up to; _gari_, direction of; _kara_, from; _kara_ (_gara_) =
_nagara_ (_naru karada_ or _naru kara_), just as (applied to preceding
noun); after verbs, whilst, although.

_kaku_, thus, _to mo kaku mo_, that way and this way, anyhow, somehow.

_kashi_, be it thus, so be it, may it be so! (Aston).

_mashi_ (_mase_, &c.), _mahoshiki_, verbal terminations expressing
desire or contingency.

_meru_, verbal termination (derived from fut. in _mu_, _mu_ or _mi
aru_?), indicates some degree of likelihood.

_ramu_, for _aramu_, _hana chiruramu_ = _hana chiru aramu_ = _hana
chiramu_, the flowers will, wilt.

_rashi_ = _ramu_, nearly; _natsu kitarurashi_, seemeth the summer to
have come (Aston). There is an adjectival ending, _rashiki_, of similar
import.

Of the syntax of Old Japanese little need be said. It is simple owing
to the absence of almost the whole apparatus of Western grammar. The
order of words has already been mentioned, and in prose is rigid--in
poetry inversions are common. In large measure it is the opposite of
English order, and this fact, together with the relegation of the verb
to the end of the sentence, and the absence of expressed subject,
constitutes the initial and principal difficulty of Japanese, apart
from that of the vocabulary, the elements of which have usually a
connotation different from that of their nearest representatives in
any Western language. The absence of relatives and paucity of pronouns
are additional difficulties, and the reader has to grow familiar by
practice with the modes in which the more definite thought of the West
is represented in the vaguer and looser language of Old Japan, where
the visual aids of later Sinico-Japanese are not present. Nevertheless
if the real meanings of the words be attained, the logical subject
kept in mind as gathered from the context, the relations of words and
phrases in apposition rather than in accidental or strict syntactical
connexion be observed, the influence of the particles in edifying the
sentence into a construction understood, and some facility gained in
keeping the mind in suspense until the principal verb--read with the
relations to it of the subordinate verbs--be reached, there is no great
difficulty, apart from the inevitable one of difference of circumstance
and allusion, in arriving at a comprehension of the texts. And these
will be found, especially the Lays, to have preserved a peculiar beauty
and charm, if not of the highest order, of their own, which no version
can hope to convey.

The opening of the first lay sufficiently exemplifies the reversed
order of the Japanese sentence:--

        Ko mo yo
      mi ko mochi
    fukushi mo yo

    fukushi mochi
      kono woka ni
    na tsumasu ko--

Read almost directly backwards, we get:--

_Ko_ (maid) _tsumasu_ ([who] plucks) _na_ (salads) _ni_ (on) _kono
woka_ (this knoll), _mochi_ (holding) _fukushi_ (truel), _yo mo_ (oh
the) _fukushi_ (truel), _mochi_ (holding) _mi ko_ (fair basket), _mo
yo_ (oh the) _ko_ (basket).

Maid who pluckest salads on this knoll holding a truel--oh the
truel!--holding a fair basket--oh the basket!… _a wo se to norame_, me
for thy husband name!

But even rendered almost in Japanese order, the lay is quite
intelligible, and perhaps better to be appreciated than in any
imitative version:--

    Basket O! | fine basket bearing | truel O | fine truel bearing
    | this knoll upon | herb-plucking maid! | your home-place tell
    me | your name too tell me; | Yamato’s land | everywhere | I
    hold rule over, | all where | I hold rule over, | me in sooth |
    as husband call me | your homeplace too, your name too, tell me!

In dealing with the less easy texts of the Manyôshiu the following
considerations must be kept in mind:--

The honour-forms (see below) indicate a (logical) second or third
person, or something connected with such a person, directly or
indirectly.

The particle _wo_ may often be rendered as if _ni_, or as an
exclamation, or as if followed by some form of _omofu_. I do not regard
it as in itself a quasi-conjunction. The various functions of _no_ must
be kept in mind.

The frequency of inversion in order of words must not be forgotten.
The _makura kotoba_ may be ruled out, as well as prefaces, exordiums,
introductions, and the like--thus the kernel of meaning may be got at,
and the decoration then added.

It must be recollected that of the elements of the vocabulary very few
can be exactly rendered by a single English word, their connotation
for the most part is more or less different from that of any possible
English equivalent. In the Glossary an exhaustive definition of
the meaning is not attempted, enough only is given to suggest the
translation of the sentence in which the word appears. Hence since
meanings came to change in the course of time, those given being
only what are required for these texts sometimes differ from the
meanings found in the foreign dictionaries, all of which are very
imperfect--very seldom, however, from those offered by that excellent
native dictionary the _Kotoba no Izumi_.


THE LANGUAGE OF THE MANYÔSHIU

I found the following remarks upon the somewhat lengthy, and--to
me--not always very clear, observations of Masazumi concerning
the language of the Manyôshiu contained in his _sôron_ or General
Introduction.

PHONETIC CONTRACTIONS. These are not uncommon, and are principally
vocalic. Such are _wagimo_ (my sister) for _waga imo_; _ariso_ (wild
shore) for _ara iso_; _kafuchi_ (within the rivers) for _kaha uchi_;
_amori_ (descent from heaven) for _ame ori_; _kurenawi_ (a shade of
red) _kure no awi_, lit. an indigo (i.e. a dye) brought from China;
_konure_ (tree-top) _ko no ure_; _ke_ (come, pass) _ki he_--_ke nagaku
kohishi_, long time loved; _ke no kono goro ha_, a time lately gone by;
_arumi_ (wild sea) _ara umi_; _futsuma_ (stout horse) _futo uma_. The
above are substantival, others are adjectival or verbal, as:--

_naru_ (be in, at, of), _ni aru_, as in _Yamato naru_, _ihe naru_, &c.

_nari_--_ni ari_, as _oto su nari_ = _oto suru de ari_.

_naru_--_no aru_, as _hana naru toki_ = _hana no aru toki_.

_sareba_--_shi areba_, as _haru sareba_.

_chifu_--_to ifu_ (they call, ’tis called).

_ku_, _ki-yu_; _ke_, _ki-he_; _mesage_, _meshiage_; _kakage_, _kaki
age_; _motage_, _mote age_, &c.

PHONETIC EXTENSIONS. Such are:--

_nagaru_--_nagarafu_, _nagarahi_, flow, flow in quantity, &c.

_yobu_--_yobafu_, _yobahi_, call, invite, pay court to (girl).

_nageku_--_nagekafu_, _nagekahi_, draw deep breath, lament, &c.

So causative forms exist used as honour-forms, _nagekasu_ for _nageku_,
and a termination in _aku_ as _nagekaku_, _kakemaku_, _ihaku_, for
_nageku_, _kakemu_, _ifu_ used substantively. _Ihafu_, bless, is
perhaps an extension of _ifu_, speak, say.

Of _yobahi_ (_yobu_ extended) a humorous explanation is sometimes
given, _yo_ (by night) _hahi_ (creep), visit stealthily by night.
Etymology of this kind is extremely easy in Japanese.

AUXILIARY PARTICLES (_tasuke kotoba_):--

Such are _shi_ (emphatic), _kami-yo shi omohoyu_, _ihe shi shinubayu_.

_wo_ (emphatic), as in _yatsu yo ni wo_, _tanushiku wo arana(mu)_,
but in phrases like _mitsutsu yukamu wo_, _wo_ = _mono wo_.

_ya_, _ame shiru ya_, _ama tobu ya_, _kashikoki ya_, _Afumi no
ya_, _naku ya uguhisu_, &c.; but in _kimi ya komu_, _ya_ is
dubitative--interrogative. In _kakusafubeshi ya_, _sugi nikerazu ya_,
_ya_ = _ya ha_ = Lat. _num_.

_nane_, term of address and endearment, must not be confused with
_nane_ of _imonane_, _senane_, which are terms of relationship.

_i_ suffixed as in _sekimori-i_, _Unahi-wotoki-i_ may be regarded as
emphatic, or isolative (like _ha_, according to Chamberlain), or as
etymologically = the Korean postposition _i_ (Aston).

_we_, a terminal interjection as _are ha sabushi we_.

_ro ka mo_, _tafutoki ro ka mo_, here _ro ka mo_ = is it not so even!
_ro_, according to Mr. Chamberlain, is a post-position equivalent to
_te_ or _nite_.

_mo_, _mo yo_, _mo ya_, _shi mo_, _ya shi_, _yo shi_, are all
interjectional expressions, not mere fill-gaps, variously emphasizing
or calling attention to the meaning of the words, &c., they are
attached to.

HONOUR-WORDS. Such are _ohomi_ (exalted, grand), as _ohomi kami_,
_ohomi uta_, _ohomi ma_; _mi_, as _mikokoro_, _miko_, _mi-hakashi_,
_mi-keshi_, _mi-nemasu_ (His godship the God, His Majesty’s song, His
Majesty’s horse, my lord’s meaning, my lord the Son (Prince), girt by
my lord, my lord’s garments, my lord sleeps).

Other honour- (or praise-) words are:--

_oho_ (great), _futo_ (stout), _toyo_ (rich), _o_ (for _oho_) as in
_obito_, _omi_ (court officials); _mi_, _ma_, _mo_, _sa_, _oho_ also
denote excellence (εὐ), _wo_ may be antithetic to _oho_, or it may be a
term of intimacy, a sort of diminutive of endearment.

The following honour-verbs should be here noted. _Tamafu_, _tamaheru_,
_tamahari_, _oboshimesu_, _kikoshimesu_, _shiroshimesu_, _takashiru_,
_owasu_, _owashimasu_, _masu_, _mimakareru_; verbs in causative form,
_-asu_, _-saseru_, _-seshimu_; verbs in quasi-passive or potential,
_-uru_, _-ruru_, _raruru_.

Other laudatory expressions are _tama_ (precious), _uma_ (delicious,
fine), _midzu_ (brilliant, fine), _umashi_ (_uma_), _kuhashi_ (lovely).
A curious gradation of honour-forms is seen in the following: _mi
yomimaseru ohomi uta_ (where the lay is attributed to a mikado), _ohomi
uta_, _mi uta_, _yomitamaheru uta_, _yomeru uta_ (when the author is
_miko_, _ason_, or official of lower rank).

Among terms of affection may be noted:--

_waga_ (mine) or _wago ohokimi_, _waga kimi_, _waga kuni_, _waga se_,
_wagimo_, _a oto_, _ago_, _na_, _se na_, _na se nane_, _nanimo_, _imo
nane_ (my great lord, my lord, our land, my husband, my younger sister
(wife or mistress), my brother, my child, thou, thou elder brother,
elder brother thou, thou elder sister, thou younger sister, &c.).

Words of exclamation, hope, entreaty, wonder, &c.:--

_Ana_, _ana ni_ (_ni_ is not a particle), _ya_ (= _yo!_), _ka_ (= ?),
_kana_, _gana_, _mo gana_, _kamo_, _mo ga mo_, _moga_, _ga mo na_, _ya
mo_, _shika_, _sane_, _ne_, _kose_, _kosene_, _na-so na-yume_, _ari
kosenu ka mo_ (_ari-koso-ne_). These are explained in the notes to the
text or in the glossary--their meaning is obvious for the most part.

Repetitive or cumulative expressions (_kasane kotoba_) are common
in the Manyôshiu and contain, mostly, a quibble in meaning or rhyme
in sound. Such are _chichi no mi no chichi_ (father = _chichi_ =
maiden-hair tree--the quibble is on the two _chichi_, and the double
meaning of _mi_, fruit and person). _Hahasoba no haha_, mother
(_haha_), as of the oak (_hahaso_ = Quercus dentata), &c. _Shiga
no karasaki sakiku araba_ (here the rhyme is _Karasaki_ (Cape Kara
in Shiga) and _sakiku araba_ (if flourish)). Such expressions are
explained in the notes or glossary.

Other repetitive expressions are simply emphatic or poetic: _Tsudohi
tsudohi imashite_, they (the gods) assembling, _kamu hafuri hafuri_,
burying--burying him (a mikado or miko) as a god; _ake no sohobune
sohobune_, a red red-stained red-stained-ship, &c.

WORDS RELATING TO THE SOVRAN. _Sumeramikoto_ (Supreme Majesty) is
found only in the _dai_ (arguments), not in the _uta_. The commonest
term in the latter is _Ohokimi_ (great Lord, grand seigneur), but this
expression is not confined to the Sovran. Other terms are _sumeragi_
(_sumerogi_, _suberogi_) and _sumerami_; _-gi_ = prince, _mi_ =
princess (conf. Izanagi and Izanami, Inviting Male and Inviting Female
(K.)); but see Aston, _Shintô_. What _sume_ means is uncertain, it
may be connected with _sube_ (_shiru_), universally know, i.e. govern
the land. Other expressions are _kamuro kamu subera_ or _sumera_ or
_sumero_, _kamu_ adding the notion of ‘divine’. _Ohokimi_, ‘chief’, I
take to be the oldest; the other forms smack of China. As to ‘ro’, see
above remarks on the particle ‘ro’. In the Kogi etymology _ro_ = the
_re o_ of _are oya_ in _kamu are oya_ = god-born ancestry.

_Mikado_ means grand gate or palace, and by metonymy came to signify
its lord, just as at the present day _miya_ (grand mansion) denotes
an imperial prince. _Mikado_ also means ‘sovran dominion’ as in
_toho-mikado_, distant palace, that is, wide dominion, sometimes
applied specially to the Tsukushi government, to Korea, or even to
China, as on the confines of, but still within, the authority of the
_Ohokimi_ of Japan. The following phrases may be here noticed--_mikoto
kashikomi_, dread majesty, _Ohokimi no make_ (or _hiki_) _no manimani_,
in obeisance to the _Ohokimi’s_ will or appointment.

_Mi_ has several meanings which must be distinguished. They are (1) an
honour-prefix, grand, great; (2) prefix of praise, εὐ = _ma_, true,
real; (3) self; (4) body, person; (5) a stem of _miru_, see (6) root
of _midzu_; (7) fruit of tree or herb; (8) the numeral three; (9) as
a termination _se wo hayami_, swift the stream; _hiromi_, broad-like;
_fukami_, deep.

Of the intensive prefixes _i_, _ka_, and _ta_, no explanation has yet
been given. They resemble Greek ζα. Examples are _i-yuki_, _ka-guroki_,
_ta-moto-horu_.

For the purposes of the present work, Dr. Aston’s grammar of the
written language (third edition) is much the most useful.


THE SCRIPT OF THE MANYÔSHIU

The Lays are written wholly in Chinese characters. But these are
employed in several very peculiar ways, and the texts as they stand
are completely unintelligible to a Chinese, even to a Japanese,
who has not specially studied them. In all the editions, however,
except the Riyakuge, the columns of text are accompanied by a _kana_
transliteration--in the Riyakuge the _kana_ (_hira_) transliteration is
given separately from the text.

At the date of the compilation of the Anthology--the middle of the
eighth century--neither of the existing Japanese syllabaries had been
invented. Their creation is ascribed to the learned priest _Kûkai_
(_Kôbô Daishi_), the Doctor Promulgator of the Law of Buddha, who died
in 834, nearly a hundred years later than the date of the final _tanka_
of the Manyôshiu. The Chinese character had therefore, perforce, to
be employed in writing down the lays collected in the manner set
forth in the volume of translations. The ideographs were used in part
phonetically, in part lexicographically, as they had already been used
in writing the Kojiki and the poems cited in that history, and in the
almost contemporaneous but very different Nihongi.

The ideographs used phonetically were not, however, always employed in
the same way. The forty-seven sounds of the syllabary--

    _a_      _i_      _u_          _e (ye)_   _o_
    _ka_     _ki_     _ku_         _ke_       _ko_
    _sa_     _shi_    _su_         _se_       _so_
    _ta_     _chi_    _tsu_        _te_       _to_
    _na_     _ni_     _nu_         _ne_       _no_
    _ha_     _hi_     _f(h.w.)u_   _he_       _ho_
    _ma_     _mi_     _mu_         _me_       _mo_
    _ya_              _yu_                    _yo_
    _ra_     _ri_     _ru_         _re_       _ro_
    _wa_     _wi_                  _we_       _wo_

--were already recognized, and were represented by a sort of alphabet
composed of several hundreds of Chinese ideographs, each pronounced
exactly or approximately _sinice_--that is _japonico-sinice_, or
according to _on_ or Chinese sound. Thus a was represented by two
ideographs, 阿 (_a_ in Chinese) and 安 (_an_ in Chinese), _shi_ by
twenty-five characters, such as 志 (_chih_ in Chinese), 思 (_ssu_ in
Chinese), &c. The other sounds were represented by varying numbers of
characters. According to this system, _ame_ (heaven or rain) would
or might be written 安米, _tsuchi_ (soil) 都知 and so forth. A complete
list of these Chinese phonetic ideographs is given in the _Sôron_
(Introductory) volume of the Kogi.

A second method of using the ideographs was to employ them according to
their _kun_ (reading i.e. in pure Japanese), thus _utate_ (extremely)
was represented by 得田手, _chihahi_ (for _sachihafi_, bless) by 千羽日.
Sometimes two characters represented one sound, thus 嗚呼 for _a_, 五十
(_isozhi_) for _i_, 牛鳴, _ushi no naku_, ‘moo’ of cow, for _mu_. Some
sounds (_ku_, _ri_, _ru_, _ro_, _wa_) are not found thus symbolized,
that is, _japonicé_. A curious double character is 石花 for _se_, another
is 羊{蹄} (_hitsuzhi no ashi_) for _shi_. A third and very confused
script is exemplified in 還金 _kaherikomu_ (return), where _kaheri_ is
_kun_ and _komu_ (kon) is _on_, and 知三 _shirasamu_ (shall know), where
_shira_ is _kun_ modified grammatically, and _samu_ (_san_ = three) is
_on_ representing the inflexion.

Still more confusingly, an ideograph may be used with an _on_ (Chinese)
sound resembling a _kun_ (native) word, and the _kun_ word may be
employed, not in its natural sense, but as it were punningly, though
more often no quibble is intended. Thus 兼 of which the _on_ is _ken_,
may be used for the verbal termination _kemu_, as in 茢兼 (_karikemu_,
will have reaped), where 茢 is employed lexicographically as _kemu_, as
just explained. So 不有君 does not mean _kimi arazu_ (lord is not) but
_ari nakuni_, as there is not. Similar examples are _kaherikomu_ and
_shirasamu_ cited above. So 難 _nan_ (difficult) for _nani_, what?, {點}
_ten_ for _-temu_; 徳 _toku_ for _toko_, and so forth.

Or the Japanese reading of a character may be taken, but in a
signification different from its true meaning, thus 庭 _niha_, a court
or yard, for the particles _ni ha_, 玉 _tama_, jewel or pearl, for
_tamashii_, soul, or even 湯龜 _yu-game_ = water-tortoise for _yukame_ =
will go, or the combination 石二 = stone-two, which puzzled Shitagau so
sorely, and finally turned out to mean _made_ = until, to which may be
added the commonest of all 鴨 = _kamo_, a wild duck, used for _ka mo_,
an expression of mingled entreaty and doubt.

The above devices were no doubt resorted to partly to supply the place
of a syllabary, partly for purposes of abbreviation, the full writing
of long Japanese words with a Chinese character for each syllable being
found too laborious.

But characters are often also used in a punning or humorous way. Thus
二二 = 2 × 2 are employed to represent the syllable _shi_ (which means
4 in Japano-Chinese), but here is used phonetically to represent the
emphatic particle _shi_ or the syllable _shi_ merely. So 山上復有山 =
mountain 山 upon mountain to represent 出 _idzuru_, go forth, out, &c.,
三伏一向衣 = three-prostrations-one-regard-night, i.e. a moonlight night
(when one salutes the moon), 八十一 (81) as equivalent to _ku ku_, nine
times nine, part of the word _kukumeru_ (= _fukumeru_, hold in mouth,
imply), and so forth. Characters used otherwise than to express their
true meaning are called _kariji_, borrow-characters, i.e. characters
borrowed to signify some other meaning than their own. Characters used
in the orthodox manner are called _manaji_--true characters.

There are also _guji_, 具字 double characters used, where one would
suffice, thus 何物 for 何 _nani_. This is probably a mere embellishment.

Contracted script is not uncommon; thus we find 山下 for 山下出風 = _arashi_,
a violent wind (rushing down from the mountains).

Lastly, there are abbreviated characters--a full list of which is given
in the Kogi, together with a few characters peculiar to the Anthology
and contracted expressions such as _amori_ for _ame ori_, _Yamato naru_
for _Y. ni aru_, _haru sareba_ for _haru shi areba_, _chifu_ for _to
ifu_ (modern _tefu_ = _chō_ of Kyôto), and so forth.

The above system of scripts is known as Manyôgaki and is sometimes
imitated in modern productions as in a recently published play now
before me.

Texts preserved in such scripts could not fail to be corrupt or obscure
in parts. Not only from the difficulty of reading the ideographs when
these came to be translated into _kana_, but from the fact that the
manuscripts were often in _cursive_ character, easily misread and
miswritten by the copyists. The text of the Manyôshiu I have used is
throughout that of the Kogi, but I have not omitted in the notes to
the translations to give some attention to the various readings cited
in that work. By far the best discussion of these seems to be that
of Keichiu which with the Kogi is much superior in my opinion to the
commentary of either Mabuchi or Motowori[6]--the latter especially
appears to be lacking in critical acumen.

The following additional remarks on the script are important. According
to Amano Nobukage (died 1734), in the Manyô script the Chinese
characters are read _japonicé_ in four ways:--

1. _mana_, as 心 _kokoro_ (heart, mind, &c.), where single characters
are read as true Japanese words.

2. Where combined characters are read true, as 春霞 _harukasumi_
(spring-mist); 秋風 _aki-kaze_ (autumn-wind).

3. Where combined characters are read in full, but the meaning of
the whole is not the sum of the meanings of the parts, as 垣津{旗}
_kakitsubata_ (Iris laevigata)--the characters separately mean--_kaki_
(fence), _tsu_ (place), _hata_ (flag).

4. Where combined characters are read together as a whole, as 春鳥
_uguhisu_ (Cettia cantans), lit. spring-bird; 三五夜 _mochidzuki_
(full-moon), lit. three-five-night = fifteenth night of a lunar month,
when the moon is full.

To these categories must be added that of humorous combinations, thus
十六 (sixteen) = _shi shi_ (4 × 4), and is used for _shishi_ (flesh);
靑頭鷄 _kamo_ (wild-duck), lit. green-head-fowl.

In the Kogi text the characters are used in the following modes, all of
which are fully illustrated by examples in a section of the _sōron_ or
General Introduction to the Edition.

A. According to the _on_ or Chinese sound (Japano-Chinese).

    1. Full, as 阿 _a_, 伊 _i_; so in Chinese.

    2. Contracted, as 安 _a_, 印 _i_; in Chinese _an_, _in_.

B. According to the _kun_ (_yomi_) or Japanese reading.

    1. 天 _ame_ (heaven), 地 _tsuchi_ (earth), 大地 _ohotokoro_ (great
    place). Each character is here read with one of its ordinary
    Japanese pronunciations and meanings.

    2. Combined characters of similar meaning read as one word
    (Japanese)--明淸 _akirakeku_ (bright).

    3. Combined characters of different meaning read as one
    word--海士 _ama_ (fisherman), 蜻蛉 _akitsu_ [or _seirei_]
    (dragon-fly).

    4. The characters are read as = a Chinese translation of the
    Japanese word--行知所 _shiroshimeshi_ (govern).

    5. The character or combination is read according to an ancient
    meaning--不知 _isa_ (no, not so), 服 _hada_ (naked skin).

    6. The character is read specially--縵 _kadzura_ (chaplet), 棟
    _kura_ (saddle).

    7. The character is abbreviated--建 for 健, 已 for 起.

In addition the Kogi gives the following categories:--

_gikun_, combinations not literally translated into Japanese--玄{黄}
_ametsuchi_ (heaven and earth), lit. dark-blue (of sky) and
yellow-brown (of earth), 親親 _chichi-haha_ (parents, father and mother),
lit. love-love. A great many of these are given; many would scarcely
suggest the meaning of the combination; sometimes, as when 蓋 _futa_
(lid), is used to express 二 _futa_ (two), a word-play is involved.

_kariji_ or borrowed characters which have been already
exemplified. But one curious expression may be added, {喚}犬{追}馬鏡
_masokagami_ (true-pure-mirror), the characters mean call (or
bark?)-dog-follow-horse (_ma_) mirror; call-dog-follow is a humorous
(?) description of _ma_, meaning horse, but here used for the homophon
_ma_, true, εὐ, part of _ma so_, which has the same meaning.

Subjoined is the script of the text of Lay 118 which well exemplifies
the peculiarities of Manyôgaki. The columnar transliteration represents
the similar transliteration into syllabic _kana_ in the usual editions
inclusive of the Kogi.

6 _i_, a prefix of which the value is lost.

9 _nari_ here means sound, twang.

12 _tatasurashi_ = _tatsuramu_.

2 _Uchi_ may = _utsutsu_, or possibly _ude_, arm.

For _yasumishishi_, _mi torashi no_, _adzusa no yumi_ and _tamakiharu_
see List of m. k. The m. k. it must be remembered are epithets, or
expressions in the nature of epithets, only. Thus 7, 8 and 15, 16 are
simply double m. k. of _nari_, indeed _nari hazu no_ is almost another
m. k. of _oto_.

4 _fumasuramu_ = _fumamu_.

In the _dai_ the _no_ after _Ohokimi_ is read with _yomi … uta_. In 3
and 22 _ni_ is rather a verbal form (_nu_) than a postposition.

8 _uranage_ = _uchi ni nageki_, inwardly, profoundly, lamenting.

10 _kake_ (_kakuru_) a verb of wide connotation, fundamentally, hang on
or over, suspend, put to, forth or on, _[kotoba wo] kake_, utter, as
here.

18 _kaherahinureba_ = _kaherinureba_.

19 _masurawo_ is said to be _ma-ara shi-wo_, right-bold-man, or better
(more grammatically) _masa_ (or _masu_)_-ara-wo_, which has the same
meaning.

22 _shi_ is a particle of emphasis.

23 _omohi-yaru_, thought-send-away, get rid of (unpleasing) thoughts;
_omohi_, common throughout the Lays, means think, think affectionately
or regretfully of, &c.

3 _nuru yo ochizu_, without missing a sleeping night.

5 _kakete_ = _kokoro ni kakete_, bearing in mind. _shinubu_ is to love,
yearn for, regret. _omohi_ is the more general term, _shinubu_ more
special, _shitahi_, affection, _kofuru_, _kohi_, &c., love of men and
women. But these connotations are not strictly adhered to.

In the _dai_ _… meshishi_ is the participial past form of _mesu_.
Care must be taken to distinguish between this _shi_ and such a
terminational _shi_ as _narurashi_ (6), _koshi_ (4).

1 Read _Kaguyama ha Unebi wo yeshi to_ (_te_) _Miminashi to ahi
arisohi_.

4 Observe the past form in _ki_.

6 _narurashi_ = _naramu_, nearly.

3 _kikoshiwosu_; _wosu_ is to eat; _kikoshi_, honour-causative
intensitive of _kiku_, hear, have sensation of, taste, judge, &c.; the
whole = _kikoshimesu_, to be supreme over, govern. The idea, perhaps,
was that of the chief having complete control of all the wealth of the
tribe originally for the subsistence of himself and his _gesyth_.

5 _shi mo_, a pair of emphatic particles. _Shi_ perhaps was originally
this or that, or this or that self (or it may be root of _suru_, to do,
act); _mo_ is merely, also, too. _Shi mo_ almost = _naho_.

6 _saha_, abundant. The homonym _saha_ also means a marshy
valley-bottom, in Japano-Chinese _taku_. Hence by a rebus-wise use of
the Chinese character _taku_ continued with _san_ mountain (_yama_)
came to be _takusan_, a common word for much, many.

11 For _hana-chiru_.

19 _kihohi_ = _kisohi_ (_gihohi_).

26 _taki_ or _tagi_ = cascade, rapids, descriptive of neighbourhood of
the _miyako_.

27 _ka mo_, an elliptical expression, _omofu_ being understood, almost
= _mo gana_.

3 _kamu_ = _kami_.

4 _kamu sabi sesu_, _sabi_ is viewed in the Kogi as contraction of
_shika-buri_. More likely _sabi_ is connected with _sabu_ (_shiki_) and
_samushi_.

8 _takashiri …_, to exercise high rule.

13 _yamatsumi_, compare _watatsumi_ (_yama-wata-tsu [ka] mi_), mountain
gods. I prefer this to Dr. Florenz’s etymology (F. I. 39).

14 _shimoto_, brushwood, bushes.

14, 22 _oshinabe_ = _oshinabikasu_, push-bend-down. _shinu_ =
_shinaheru_, intensifies the meaning; _shinu_, _shinubu_, _shinaheru_,
_shinahi_, _shinadaru_ are all etymologically and logically connected.

19 _mi_ = _utsukushii_.

21 A tall full-spiked grass, probably an Arundo or Miscanthus.

4 _hi no miko_ is the Queen-Regnant Jito, the subject of all the verbs
down to _tamaheba_ (v. 12).

15 _hi no tate_ must here mean the East, and _hi no yoko_ (21), lit.
the noon-sun direction, must mean the West.

27 _sotomo_, hinder, shady, or north face.

33 _kagetomo_, light or south face. The exact distribution, however,
of the meaning of these terms is not quite clear; _hinotate_, _hi no
yoke_, _sotomo_, _kagetomo_.

37, 39 I take the _ya_ as interjectional.

39 _ame-shiru_, heaven-rule.

40 I take the _no_ as connecting 37-40 with _midzu_ in 41. The text
is not easy, and the Kogi seems to me rather to shirk the main
difficulties.

3 _are-tsugu_ = _arahare-tsugu_, be manifest, i.e. follow in succession.

vv. 1-14 compare the Princess with the _mo_ and hint at her death, the
water-weeds will be renewed in due course, but she will not come back
to life; 15 is best understood by being read in connexion with 24;
16-21 describe the grace of the Princess; 22-26 suggest the fault of
the Prince which interrupted the relations of the pair; 27-42 describe
the happiness of the pair during the Princess’ life; 43-60 picture the
grief of the Prince at her loss, and 61 to end add the reflections of
the poet.

The m. k. (1) applies to Asu[ka], of (43) to Ki[nohe], of (47) to
_me_ (taken as contraction of _mure_), of (55) to _nayete_.

vv. 1-11 are introductory to _imo_; 12-16 declare impossibility of
escaping the fate of all mankind; 17-20 refer to the funeral of the
_imo_; 21-24 to her burial; 25-32 to the father’s endeavour to comfort
the child; 33-42 to the desolation of his home; 43 to end to the ascent
of the hill of interment in the vain hope of seeing her spirit.

2 _omohishi_, here, as often, is little more than _narishi_.

22 _i-mashite_, _i_ is here merely a prefix.

30 _shi_ is an emphatic particle.

31 _zhi_ = _nasu_ (so in 21).

34 A past of _neru_.

42 A common phrase = _shikata ga nai_.

52 = _yoki, koto naki_.

55 Note the application of the m. k. to _ho_(_noka_). Read the latter
verses as _honoka ni sahe mo imo ga miyenu wo omoheba kurushiku
hatarakite koshi kahi mo naku yoki koto so naki_.

vv. 1-6 introduction; 7-16 impermanence of life; 17-20 regret of
poet at news of death (hinted at rather than directly stated) of the
_uneme_; 21 to end climatic lament over an untimely death.

2 _shitaberu_ = wilt, wither, droop; _akiyama no shitaberu imo_,
drooping as the flaccid leafage in autumn on the hills: but see
translation.

1, 2 and 3, 4 are parallelisms reminding one of Hebrew and Chinese
poetry, there are several other examples in this _uta_.

4 _kora_ seems to be a plural form of honour.

8 The _wo_ at the end, which has a stray look, may be understood here
(as often elsewhere in the Anthology) by supplying _omoheba_ or some
form of the verb _omofu_. The various _ha_ in this _uta_ exemplify the
effect of the particle as suggesting a predicate of the isolated word
or expression.

18 The news has come to me who only slightly knew her by sight yet am

1, 2 _karu_ _kara_, probably a designed jingle.

4, 5 would I were but a cormorant, then I should be free from

As to the m. k. _shikitahe_ and _umasahafu_: _shikitahe_, spread-cloth,
seems originally to have meant a garment worn to sleep in, or a
coverlet. It is applied to night, sleeping, night garments, pillows, &c.

_Umasahafu_ is the reading preferred by the Kogi to that in the text,
_ajisahafu_. Of neither can any certain explanation be given. On the
whole I am inclined to prefer the one suggested of _umasahafu_ under
that word in the Kogi’s list of _makura kotoba_.--_umashi-aha-fu_,
field of sweet millet; _ahafu_ = millet-field in K. 143, n. 2, _fu_
is perhaps an original form of _hafu_ or _hae_. The ancient Japanese
_f_ (perhaps derived from a lost _p_) was something like the Highland
‘fwh’ in ‘fwhat’ of which the different elements were prominent in
connexion with particular vowel sounds. As significant of numerousness,
it is applied to _mure_ (flock, crowd) contracted into _me_ (to which
through a homophon meaning ‘woman’ it is applied in the text) as well
as sometimes to _yoru_, night (homophon of _yoru_, gather together,
collect). There are parallel etymologies quoted by the Kogi, but
it is needless to detail them here. _Umashiahafu_ would contract
into _umasahafu_; _umashi_ may be written with a character _aji_,
meaning taste, savour--hence _ajisahafu_, and of this the _aji_ might
be confounded with its homonym _aji_ (a kind of teal or widgeon),
explaining a common way of writing the expression--teal-marsh-abundant.

For _umasahafu_, _shikitaheno_ see List m. k.

3 I have followed the Kogi reading of the curiously involved script of
this passage, _hitori ko [ni ko] wo_ = _hitori ko [wo ko] wo_.

4 _ihe_ written _i-ho-he_ (500 houses) for _ihe_ (_iheru_).

11 _ihahihe_ is here a jar, not _he_ a place, _ni_ = together with.

1, 2 form a preface applying to _imo_, (17) to A[dzuma], (29) to _yuki_

The m. k. are: _hashi-mukafu_ (of _oto_), lit. as like as the members
of a pair of chop-sticks = fraternal relation (of affection);
_asa-tsuyuno_ (of _ke-_ or _kihe-yasuki_), [evanescent as] morning dew;
_hafu-tsutano_ (cling-ivy--of _wakareshi_), parted as reluctantly as
ivy parts from its stem; _amakumono_ (also of _wakareshi_); _yami-yo
nasu_ (of _omohi madohahi_); _iyushishino_ (wounded deer) of _kokoro_;
_ashikakino_ (reed-fence) of _midarete_; _haru-torino_ (of _ne_);
_umasahafu_ (see List m. k.).

2 _nashi_ = bring up.

6 _ke_ = _kihe_.

11 _ihe_ means a place of residence. _nami_ is _nasa_, not-being-ness.

21 _iyu_ = passive of _i_, aim at, shoot; like _miyu_ from _mi_, see;
_kikoyu_ from _kiku_, hear.

27 The Kogi interpolates the verses _me goto mo tayete_ | _nubatama
no_--_nubatama_ being itself a m. k. _Kagirohino_ is a m. k. of
_moyetsuru_, see List m. k., also K. 288.

The construction of the _uta_ offers no particular difficulty.

23 This reading differs from Motowori’s, which is _yori-kagure_, _yuki_
= _yuki-kaheri_, involving frequency of the action denoted by _kagahi_
= _kake-ahi_, i.e. the meeting of both sexes.

33, 34 are more intelligible if _ka_ is read after _tanashirite_.

3 to stand treading on the ground, stand awhile there--or to stand as
usual there or stand often there?

Winabe no takumi_, the much-to-be-regretted carpenter. But the epithet
here may refer to _wi_ (well), part of the name Winabe, and probably
means fresh. _Takumi_, however, is more than ‘carpenter’, rather
‘builder’ or ‘architect’.

9 _oyuraku_ = _oyu koto_, fact of being or growing old.

Motowori’s reading.

10 _kikosedomo_ = _notamahedomo_.

14 _are_ = _ware_.

17 Various explanations are given of this word--Keichiu gives _asasa_,
like (_asasa_ is a sp. of Limnanthemum); Okabe reads _kazashi_,
adorn; Motowori suggests the meaning adopted by the Kogi, and in my
translation, i.e. _asane no kami_ = _nekutare-gami_. _Azane_, however,
may be perhaps better connected with _azanafu_, to bind up.

In one edition the lay begins with the fourth verse; in another the
opening is--_Komoriku no_ | _Hatsuse no kaha no_ | _wochi kata ni_ |
_imora ha tatashi_--representing the girl (_imora_) as standing on the
further (distant) bank (_wochi-kata_) of the rapid stream of Hatsusè.

The text is obscure.

4 _ake_, red. _soho bune_ is red ship.

8 _ari nami_ = _ari nabiki_. There is a play upon this _ari nami_ and
the same expression in 9.

7 Lengthened form of _hikotsuru_, go on hauling. So _ihidzurahi_ =
_ihitsuru_ (K. 343).

9 _ari nami_ is explained (Motowori) as = _inamu_, refuse, object;
_ihare nishi agami_ = such is what I bid you.

1-6 express the situation of the lover; 12-18 describe the sea-weeds on
the names of which the thought of the lay is made to turn.

17 is m. k. of _hikaba_, which refers to the breaking of the connexion.

20 _yuki_ is connected with _tsudohi_, assemble = _yukite tsudohite_.

21 is m. k. of 22.

21-26 is a prefatial m. k. of _hanachikemu_.

22 _yuki_ I take to be quiver, but having as homophon (_yuki_, go,
prefix to _tori saguri_, search, look for) the epithet _nakuko
nasu_--the idea being that of a child crying because it cannot find
some treasure it has lost.

23 is m. k. of _yu[hara]_ = _yumi no suwe_.

25 _shishiki ya_ is taken as = _shishi-ya_, game-arrow, hunter’s arrow.

26 _futatsu_ refers to _shishi ya_. _tabasami_ is to take in the hand.

27 _hanachikemu_, to let fly.

28 _hito_ is error for _ware_.

23-26 seem to be a preface to _hanachikemu_.

For _ohobuneno_, _fukamiruno_, _nahanorino_, _nakukonasu_, _adzusayumi_
see List m. k. Of course the above explanations are more or less
conjectural. The lay is a poor affair enough, but the text is
interesting on account of its complications.

1-10 suggest the death of the Miko (Takechi?); 11-18 the faithful
service of his retainers; 19 to end, their inconsolable grief.

3, 4 This common phrase seems to mean ‘for some reason or other’, an
expression used to signify dubiety of cause, real or respectful.

24 _omohi-hafuru_ = _omohi-hanachi-chirasu_.

12 _ashige_, reed-like in colour, grey; _ashigebuchi_, dappled grey.
The envoy is--_Koromode wo_ | _ashige no uma no_ | _ibayu kowe_ |
_kokoro are ka mo_ | _tsune yu ke ni naku_. Here the m. k. _koromode_,
vestment-sleeve, is curiously applied to _ashige_ as similar in sound
to _osoki_ = _uhagi_ = outer or over-garment. The meaning of _ke ni_
(異) is, differently, strangely, specially.

10 _kohinu_ is negative.

14 _seyo_, perhaps a sort of (logical) 1st pers. imperative.

30 _ne-haheru_, _nehafu_, or _nebafu_, apparently means extended

1-10 introductory to _kuhashi imo_. In the use of _kuhashime_ there
is an imitation or a reminiscence of the Kojiki lay (K. App. LXXVI)
translated in the notes to 177. _kuhashime_ = here, make-swallow,
afterwards to disgorge.

13 _nagarusa_, as far as an arrow can be shot.

25 Note the curious script for _kuku_ (_kukuri_) the figures 81 are
used, 81 = 9 x 9 = _ku ku_.

here adopted, seems simpler and sufficient.

19 _waga kokoro_, is here an exclamation.

21 _momiji-ba_ is to be read with _chiri-_ of _chirisugi_ (22), and

5-19 _tada watari_, _tadachi suguni_--is taken as involving the meaning
of _kachi watari_, to cross on foot, walk across. This sense, however,
is not altogether admissible.

1-4 The full sense of these lines it is not easy to make out.

7, 8 A very obscure passage. Some commentators suppose a silken
garment, the produce of an insect (_yamamai_, wild silkworm), to
be intended. The explanation most in accordance with the text (as
emended in the Kogi) is to take _akidzu ha_ as meaning the wing of
a dragon-fly. The passage would then be interpreted as it is in the
translation q. v.

11 _ura mo naku_, without heart, feeling, dead to external impressions.

17 = _omohoshiki_ (_omohashiki_) _koto_, something thought of, thought
of with regret, love, &c.: _omohi_ = be in a state of intellectual or
emotional consciousness.

23, 24 unable to speak, like a puling infant.

(of house or _tachi_ of Ikenushi?). The m. k. is used in reference to

(_kahi_) one’s back (_so_) to it. I am not, however, satisfied with
this explanation.

TAKETORI NO OKINA NO MONOGATARI

TEXT TRANSLITERATED




INTRODUCTION


Only three editions of the Taketori--apart from recent reprints--are
known to me: one in two thin volumes, quaintly illustrated,
block-printed in _hiragana_ with occasional _ji_ in cursive, probably
an eighteenth-, possibly a seventeenth-century production; another,
also in two volumes, _Taketori m. g. shô_ (notes), 1785, with
commentary by Koyama no Tadashi; and lastly the elaborate edition of
Tanaka Daishiu (died 1853), in six volumes[7], on which the present
translation and most of the notes thereto are based.

The text, no doubt, is more or less corrupt, and this circumstance, in
part, explains the occasional roughness of style and the absence of
proper articulation at the _juncturae_. The story of the Mikado’s suit
and of the ascension to the moon is fairly free from these defects, and
so also is the fictitious narrative, related by the sham hero of the
second Quest, of his voyage to Hôrai. Up to the seventeenth century
almost all books in Japan, with the exception of Buddhist and Chinese
reprints, were manuscripts[8], and it is possible that the Taketori,
like the Manyôshiu, was written in Chinese script[9], used more or
less phonetically. The reading of this would often be traditional,
and copyist errors would be frequent, especially in regard to cursive
forms, a combination of sources of confusion that could not but be
fruitful in corruptions, as has already been remarked in the case of
the Manyôshiu.


FOOTNOTES

[7] In which not only Koyama’s work is made use of but also the
notes of Keichiu (d. 1701) in his _Kasha_, and the suggestions of
Daishiu’s master, Motowori, the Venerable of Suzu no ya--the House of
the Horsebell--as he is termed in Daishiu’s preface and introductory
letter. An estimate of Daishiu’s work will be found _infra_.

[9] According to Lange (_Einf. in d. Jap. Schrift_) the _Katakana_
syllabary did not come into use till towards the close of the eighth
century, and the cursive syllabary (_hiragana_) was first used by
Tsurayuki in his preface to the Kokinshiu (see below), in the beginning
of the tenth century, the approximate date of the Taketori itself.

[224] _tayasuki_ = _karugarushiki_ = lightly, inconsiderately.

[225] _nagare_ = _ryu_, style, school.

[226] _makura_ seems to be a mistake for _warera_ (= we).

FOOTNOTES

[227] The text is that of the Yôkyoku Tsûge. The old name, _furuna_,
was Ahiohi (grow old together).

[228] A stage direction, it seems to mean, entry in order of actors and
songmen (_utahigata_).

[229] Prose recitation.

[230] Description of the Journey, by a member of the chorus? The syntax
of this passage and of similar passages that follow is irregular, there
is much ellipsis and some inversion. Most probably too the text--if
there ever was a settled text--is more or less corrupt. Though the
syntax and phrasing is of a rather fragmentary and disjointed character
the meaning is not usually hard to get at, if somewhat vague.

[231] This passage, like some others, must be understood metaphorically
as well as literally--here, in reference to the age of the tree and
that of the speaker. The _sashi_ of _shitesashi_ seems to indicate a
coming forward or interruption by the protagonist. _Rongi-ji_ is a sort
of dialogal chorus, and _kuse_, a statement of the precept or argument
of the _utahi_, made by one of the chorus.

[232] Chorus again.

[233] From this point the verse is irregular.

[234] Poetized prose.




MAKURA KOTOBA


A list of all the Makura kotoba contained in the Manyôshiu.

Brief explanations only are given, sufficient to suggest the meaning
which can never be strictly defined.

In the companion volume of Translations a short essay on the Makura
kotoba will be found, and in the notes to the Translations some of the
more difficult or interesting examples are discussed.

The figures denote some of the long lays in which the m. k. to
which they are attached are employed. The literal renderings are of
the characters, read _mana_, with which the m. k. are more often
written--but not so in all cases. Of many of the m. k. the meanings
are, and must remain conjectural.

be by way of quibble.

chief of the inner organs. Perhaps simply in front of the inner organs,
17, 120.

=komatsurugi=, Koma or straight sword; Koma was one of the four Korean

month, _u no tsuki_, hence used with _u_ (_tsuki_), also with

their value is uncertain. Such are Tanaga (hill-name), _ta_ = arm;
_nagi_, cast away, or mow (the arm being used)?

=koromotewo=, sleeve of a dress; used with Takaya (pl. n.), from
similarity of _taka_ with _taguru_, to haul, pull with arm; with
_wori-tamu_ (_wori-tamotohoru_, wander about), _wori-tamoto_ = roll
back sleeve; with _ashige no uma_, reed-grey horse, the peculiar

110, 157.

=kotohiushino= (_kotohi_), a great bull; used with Miyake no ura (Bay

ke_, abundance of hair, as a bull is supposed to have (a Chinese idea;
comp. ‘one hair of nine bulls’ as an infinitesimal proportion), 116.
But, perhaps, the m. k. only = grand, and _kotohi_, a sacred bull.

withering (_aru_) of vegetation under the shadow of tall grasses or
herbs.)

the only available one; used with _tabi_, journey, also with _tago_ for

explanation of its application to Yamato is that it was Yamato that the

111). More probably the m. k. means sky-shine, sky-bright, and should
be applied to _yama_ (hill), part of the name Yamato; or it may mean

as a badge. Others say _tamadzusa_ were exchanged between men and
women, as a keepsake or souvenir in Michinoku, made of paper variously
arranged to give different meanings; in Sanuki, a lover’s offering made
of straw. It may have been a spray of Catalpa (or cherry?) to which a

APPENDIX

I


The colon and semicolon are not used in the texts, the comma is
employed very sparingly, chiefly with forms of _ifu_ (say, &c.) after
quotations.

In Japanese the clauses of a sentence run together in such a way that
punctuation beyond what is adopted in this volume is better avoided.
The verbal forms (allowing for inversions) sufficiently indicate the
end of the clause in most cases.

There are no long lays in books VII, XI, XII, and XIV of the Manyôshiu.

_Nigori_ (voicing) of mutes is seldom observed; owing to its
uncertainty it would have been better to have omitted it altogether
save in a few verbal forms _-eba_ _-aba_ _-de_, _-do_ _-domo_, &c.
_Nigori_ applies to the consonants and digraphs k, s, sh, t, ch, ts, h,
which, _nigori_’ed, become g, z, zh, d, j, dz, b.

The following additions and emendations would not have been relegated
to an appendix but for the fact that certain important and not very
common works could not be procured from Japan until after the texts and
glossaries had been printed.

  Lay 14, l. 15. In the note better read ‘north or cross’ for ‘noon-sun’.

      16, 5, _kata nashi_ is perhaps a better reading.

      27, 40 n., a preferable reading is _imo ga yamazu idemishi Karu_.

      31, 10, _ika ni to toyeba_ is better than the text.

      40, 21 n., add ‘or _shima kuni_, land of islands.’

      44, 26, more correctly _abete_.

      46, 6 n., change to--‘the subject seems to be _hito_ of line 4.’

      69, 26, more probably _yami shi_ should be read.

      82, 25, _nagami_ is the correct reading.

      87, 13 n., add _nade_ = stroke, approve.

      88, 13, read _kono yama_.

      130, 2,  } the notes may be omitted.
      155, 27, }

      192, 19, line 19 is really a m. k. of Tsukushi.

      194, 11 n., add--indifferent, see Glossary.

      198, over this should be inserted the heading MAKI XV, KAMI; the
        same should be the heading of page 137.

      On page 235, line 5 from bottom, it is better to remove the quotation
        mark to ‘_mune …_, and in line 6 to read _kohishikarame_.

      In Lay 171 note 9 should be deleted and the translation consulted.

      In Lay 235, line 5, an improved reading is _mukahi tachi_.

      257, 15, the _nigori_ is better omitted, not _agari_ but _akari_, so
        in 255 (_dai_).


  Page 194, l. 35, should read _tatematsurase_.

      195, l. 18, better _makishime_.

      196, 11, 2, read _haru no ni idete_.

      203, l. 23, better a full stop after _nari--nari_. _Yo.…_

      207, l. 17, preferable to add _wo_ after _so_.

      227, l. 3 (from bottom), _no_ is better than _ha_ after _me_.

ADDENDA TO MAKURA KOTOBA
