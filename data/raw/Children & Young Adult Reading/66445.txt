as ever.”--_The Times._

=With Frederick the Great=: A Tale of the Seven Years’ War. By G. A.
HENTY. With 12 page Illustrations by WAL PAGET, and Maps. 6_s._

 “The story is one of Mr. Henty’s best, and so cleverly is history
 interwoven with fiction that the boy who reads it will know as much
 about the _Seven Years’ War_ as many an adult student of Carlyle’s
 masterpiece.”--_Standard._

=With Moore at Corunna=: A Tale of the Peninsular War. By G. A. HENTY.
With 12 page Illustrations by WAL PAGET. 6_s._

 “A very spirited story, well worthy to be ranked with the best of
 Mr. Henty’s work. Terence O’Connor, up to the time of the opening of
 the tale, has done little but get into mischief, but as soon as he
 feels the responsibility of being one of Mr. Henty’s heroes, combines
 discretion with courage, not forgetting, however, to spice the mixture
 with a little fun.”--_Spectator._

HENTY. With 12 full-page Illustrations by RALPH PEACOCK. 6_s._

 historical tales.”--_Saturday Review._

=When London Burned=: A Story of Restoration Times and the Great Fire.
By G. A. HENTY. With 12 page Illustrations by J. FINNEMORE. 6_s._

 “No boy needs to have any story of Henty’s recommended to him, and
 parents who do not know and buy him for their boys should be ashamed
 of themselves. Those to whom he is yet unknown could not make a better
 beginning than with _When London Burned_.”--_British Weekly._

 “Schoolboys owe a deep debt of gratitude to Mr. Henty.”--_The Record._

 Review._

=With Wolf in Canada=: or, The Winning of a Continent. By G. A. HENTY.
Illustrated with 12 page Pictures by GORDON BROWNE. 6_s._

 “A model of what a boys’ story-book should be. Mr. Henty has a great
 power of infusing into the dead facts of history new life, and as no
 pains are spared by him to ensure accuracy in historic details, his
 books supply useful aids to study as well as amusement.”--_School
 Guardian._

=Bonnie Prince Charlie=: A Tale of Fontenoy and Culloden. By G. A.
HENTY. Illustrated with 12 page Pictures by GORDON BROWNE. 6_s._

 “As good a narrative of the kind as we have ever read. For freshness
 of treatment and variety of incident, Mr. Henty has here surpassed

 efforts.”--_Graphic._

=True to the Old Flag=: A Tale of the American War of Independence. By
G. A. HENTY. With 12 page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE. 6_s._

 among the hostile redskins in that very Huron country which has been
 endeared to us by the exploits of Hawkeye and Chingachgook.”--_The
 Times._

HENTY. With 12 page Illustrations by C. J. STANILAND, R.I. 6_s._

 never loses its force.”--_Saturday Review._

=Redskin and Cow-boy=: A Tale of the Western Plains. By G. A. HENTY.
Illustrated by ALFRED PEARSE. 6_s._

 “It has a good plot; it abounds in action; the scenes are equally
 spirited and realistic. The pictures of life on a cattle ranche are
 most graphically painted, as are the manners of the reckless but
 jovial cow-boys.”--_Times._

(1821-1827). By G. A. HENTY. With 12 page Illustrations by W. S.
STACEY, and a Map. 6_s._

 “An excellent story, and if the proportion of history is smaller than
 usual, the whole result leaves nothing to be desired.”--_Journal of
 Education._

=The Dash for Khartoum=: A Tale of the Nile Expedition. By G. A. HENTY.
With 10 page Illustrations by J. SCHÖNBERG and J. NASH, and 4 Plans.
6_s._

 “It is literally true that the narrative never flags for a moment; the
 incidents which fall to be recorded after the dash for Khartoum has
 been made and failed are quite as interesting as those which precede
 it.”--_Academy._

=With Lee in Virginia=: A Story of the American Civil War. By G. A.
HENTY. With 10 page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE, and 6 Maps. 6_s._

 is conscientious, spirited, and ‘hard as nails’, would have been a man
 after the very heart of Stonewall Jackson.”--_Times._

=By Right of Conquest=: or, With Cortez in Mexico. By G. A. HENTY. With

 people.”--_Spectator._

 best.”--_Academy._

=Wulf the Saxon=: A Story of the Norman Conquest. By G. A. HENTY.
Illustrated by RALPH PEACOCK. 6_s._

 history than he will from many a tedious tome.”--_The Spectator._

 for boys.”--_St. James’s Gazette._

 the high standard of interest which we have learnt to expect from
 him.”--_Spectator._

 “The story of Wat Tyler’s ever-famous insurrection is set forth with a
 degree of cunning and an eye for effect that may always be looked for
 in the work that comes from this practised hand. Mr. Henty deals with

 pages of history. He is fresh, virile, and never dull, and this volume
 must needs add to his reputation.”--_Daily Telegraph._

 as indispensable to the making of an English gentleman. British lads

 we are quite sure.”--_Daily Telegraph._

=For Name and Fame=: or, Through Afghan Passes. By G. A. HENTY.
Illustrated by GORDON BROWNE. 5_s._

 “Not only a rousing story, replete with all the varied forms of

 Reviews._

 _In crown 8vo, cloth elegant._

=Condemned as a Nihilist=: A Story of Escape from Siberia. By G. A.
HENTY. Illustrated by WALTER PAGET. 5_s._

 “The best of this year’s Henty. His narrative is more interesting than
 many of the tales with which the public is familiar, of escape from
 Siberia. Despite their superior claim to authenticity these tales are
 without doubt no less fictitious than Mr. Henty’s, and he beats them
 hollow in the matter of sensations.”--_National Observer._

=Orange and Green=: A Tale of the Boyne and Limerick. By G. A. HENTY.
Illustrated by GORDON BROWNE. 5_s._

 “The narrative is free from the vice of prejudice, and ripples with

 gentleman.”--_Christian Leader._

=The Dragon and the Raven=: or, The Days of King Alfred. By G. A.
HENTY. With 8 page Illustrations by C. J. STANILAND, R.I. 5_s._

 “A story that may justly be styled remarkable. Boys, in reading it,
 will be surprised to find how Alfred persevered, through years of
 bloodshed and times of peace, to rescue his people from the thraldom
 of the Danes. We hope the book will soon be widely known in all our
 schools.”--_Schoolmaster._

=A Final Reckoning=: A Tale of Bush Life in Australia. By G. A. HENTY.
Illustrated by W. B. WOLLEN. 5_s._

 “All boys will read this story with eager and unflagging interest.
 The episodes are in Mr. Henty’s very best vein--graphic, exciting,
 realistic; and, as in all Mr. Henty’s books, the tendency is
 to the formation of an honourable, manly, and even heroic
 character.”--_Birmingham Post._

=The Young Colonists=: A Tale of the Zulu and Boer Wars. By G. A.
HENTY. With 6 Illustrations by SIMON H. VEDDER. 3_s._ 6_d._

 their chapter of adventures is so brisk and entertaining we could have
 wished it longer than it is.”--_Saturday Review._




 BY PROFESSOR A. J. CHURCH.

 “That prince of winning story-tellers, and master of musical
 English.”--_Expository Times._

 _In crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges._


=Lords of the World=: A Tale of the Fall of Carthage and Corinth. By A.
J. CHURCH. With 12 page Illustrations by RALPH PEACOCK. 6_s._

 “Mr. Church’s mastery of his subject and his literary skill are
 sufficiently complete to carry his adult readers with him. Some of
 the scenes are highly picturesque, and there is many an exciting
 adventure that sustains the reader’s curiosity in the fortunes of the
 hero, Cleanor. As a boys’ book, _Lords of the World_ deserves a hearty
 welcome.”--_Spectator._

 [Illustration: _Reduced Illustration from “Lords of the World”._]

=Two Thousand Years Ago=: or, The Adventures of a Roman Boy. By
Professor A. J. CHURCH. With 12 page Illustrations by ADRIEN MARIE.

 scenes and characters.”--_The Times._




 BY HERBERT HAYENS.


=Paris at Bay=: A Story of the Siege and the Commune. By HERBERT
HAYENS. With 8 page Illustrations by STANLEY L. WOOD. 5_s._

 “The story culminates in the terrible struggle between the
 Versaillists and the men who follow the red flag. Mr. Hayens holds the
 balance with commendable impartiality. He loves to describe a good
 soldier on whichever side he may fight. Altogether _Paris at Bay_ is
 of more than average merit.”--_Spectator._

 historical interest.”--_Times._

=Devon Boys=: A Tale of the North Shore. By G. MANVILLE FENN. With 12
page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE. 6_s._

FENN. Illustrated by GORDON BROWNE. 6_s._

=Bunyip Land=: The Story of a Wild Journey in New Guinea. By G.
MANVILLE FENN. Illustrated by GORDON BROWNE. 4_s._

Illustrations. 3_s._ 6_d._
