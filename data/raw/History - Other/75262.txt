The collection of historical material relating to his own state and
city was the absorbing interest of his later life. Accuracy and
thoroughness characterized his efforts, both as student and collector.
Evidence of his painstaking exactness may be seen in the marginal
annotations, the clippings and letters to be found in almost every
volume of his library.
