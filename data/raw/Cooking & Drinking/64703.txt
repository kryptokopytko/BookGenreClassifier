                   HOW TO CARE FOR STAINLESS COOKWARE


    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

Stainless Cookware will retain original gleaming beauty through a
lifetime of service. Just follow these simple directions:

BEFORE USING NEW UTENSILS—Wash them thoroughly both inside and out in
      hot suds. Use either soap or detergent. This removes the thin
      coating of oil which clings to the utensil in the manufacturing
      process. Rinse in clear hot water and dry thoroughly with a clean
      towel. Now the utensil is ready for use.

HEAT CONTROL—Medium to Low Heat should be used for all cooking. Start
      vegetables over medium heat. When the water comes to a boiling,
      turn to low heat to keep water boiling gently. Brown meat slowly
      over medium to low heat.

EASY CLEANING—Rinse the utensil with warm water immediately after each
      use. Food particles which do not yield to rinsing usually may be
      removed with a rubber food scraper.

FIRST AID—If food has been burned on or allowed to dry on the utensil,
      fill it with cold water. Bring the water to boiling. Remove the
      utensil from the heat and allow the water to cool to lukewarm.
      Wash in hot suds. If a stain remains, scour with fine steel wool.
      If necessary, polish with stainless steel cleaner.

DO NOT OVERHEAT—Overheating may sometimes cause discoloration on
      Stainless Steel Cookware. These stains are easily removed with any
      good stainless steel cleaner.

AVOID SUDDEN TEMPERATURE CHANGES—Sudden temperature changes and
      overheating should be avoided. DO NOT put cold water in a hot
      utensil. DO NOT set a hot utensil on a cold surface, such as the
      sink.




                     SPEND _Wisely_, SPEND _Less_!


    [Illustration: uncaptioned]


                       Take Advantage of Bargains

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

A really big step towards economical food buying is watching newspaper
advertisements. Each week the big super-markets and chain stores run all
of their weekly specials, and savings will add up fast if you plan as
many of your menus as possible around these featured items.


                             Compare Prices

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

Compare them at home in your newspaper, when you are deciding the best
place to shop and save. And compare the difference in price among fresh,
frozen, and canned foods. For example; food dollars will go a lot
further (yet meals will not suffer), if you serve frozen vegetables, or
fresh vegetables in season, on-the-plate ... and use less-expensive
canned vegetables in stews, casseroles, etc.


                         Read Labels Carefully

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

Look for the word “enriched” on white bread and flour labels. This means
that the “B” vitamins and Iron, lost in the milling process, have been
replaced. Also check the “net weight” when comparing similar bargains.


                              Avoid Waste

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

Extra-large sizes of canned fruits, vegetables, juices and staples like
baking powder may not ALWAYS be bargains. Often these purchases are only
partially used, and eventually go to waste. Unless you can use the
entire contents of the extra-large container, buy the smaller size.


                             Cut Meat Costs

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

Less tender cuts of meat are just as nutritious as the more expensive
ones. Properly cooked they are equally delicious, and you’ll be
surprised how often you can work them into well-planned menus.

Variety meats, such as heart, kidney, sweetbreads, brain, liver and
tongue are high in nutritive value and comparatively low in price.


                          Butter or Margarine?

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

These two table fats are equivalent in food value, and may be used
interchangeably in any recipe.




                           _Plan_ TO PLEASE!


    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

Plan meals when you are a little hungry ... your culinary imagination is
better then. Articles in magazines and newspapers help provide
inspiration when you need it, for greater menu variety.

When there are small children in the family, it is easier to plan meals
around the type of food small-fry can eat. Adults, too, enjoy this
simple food, which can be served in attractive and tempting
combinations.

Plan the whole day’s meals as a unit. This is the only way you can be
sure of providing the proper amount of the right kind of food.

         These are the foods needed every day for good health:

MILK—3 or 4 cups for children; 2 to 3 cups for adults. Milk used in
      cooking may be counted in the total.

VEGETABLES and FRUITS—1 serving of green, leafy or yellow vegetable; 1
      serving of citrus fruit; 1 serving of potato; 1 other vegetable or
      fruit, preferably raw. Noodles, spaghetti and macaroni cannot be
      considered substitutes for potatoes. True, they are high in
      starch, but important minerals and vitamins found in potatoes are
      lacking.

MEAT, FISH, POULTRY or CHEESE—1 serving daily.

EGGS—at least 4 a week; 1 daily is better.

Enriched or whole grain CEREALS and BREAD—2 servings or more.

BUTTER or MARGARINE—2 tablespoons or more.

EYE APPEAL—Colorful combinations are more appetizing. As you plan a
      menu, try to visualize the food as it will appear on the table.
      Strive for good contrast of flavor, color, and texture.

OFF THE BEATEN TRACK—Now and then introduce the family to a new food, or
      an old favorite in new guise. But don’t overdo it. One new food at
      a meal is enough.

DESSERT—Dessert is actually a part of the meal and should always be
      planned as such. Serve a light dessert when the main course is
      hearty. Serve rich cake and pie only when the main course is not
      too filling.

LITTLE EXTRAS—A few sprigs of parsley go a long way to make the meat
      platter more attractive. A sprinkling of paprika provides a
      flourish of color for creamed dishes.

A tray of raw relishes ... carrot sticks, celery curls, green pepper
rings, radish roses and cucumbers cut lengthwise into fingers ... may
pinch-hit for the salad occasionally.

Used with discretion, food coloring is a boon to the cook. Add a few
drops of yellow coloring to chicken gravy; a few drops of red coloring
to step up the eye appeal of desserts made with canned cherries.




                        SUPPER IN A _Half-hour_!


    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

Every homemaker needs two or three quick supper dishes “to fall back on”
when kitchen time is limited. They can be hearty and attractive, as well
as inexpensive.

Following are four such supper menus, easily prepared in about half an
hour. Three of them are planned around canned meat, dried beef and
corned beef, which should always be kept on hand for emergency meals.

Fruit in season, quick-frozen fruit, or canned fruit, well chilled,
always makes a tempting dessert. Strawberry shortcake is an all season
quick dessert, with frozen strawberries and individual sponge cakes made
especially for this purpose by professional bakers.

                           PREPARING _Meats_


    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

    [Illustration: LOW]

Cooking meat at a low temperature retains juices, reduces the amount of
shrinkage and improves the flavor. The theory that searing seals-in
juices has been disproved.

Tender cuts of meat are cooked by dry heat: roasting, pan-frying,
broiling, pan-broiling.

Less-tender cuts are cooked by moist heat: braising, stewing,
soup-making.

ROASTING—Place meat in Dutch oven, fat side up. Season with salt. Roast
      uncovered, in moderate oven (325 degrees) to desired degree of
      doneness. Do not add water; do not baste. Roast will be nicely
      browned by the time cooking is completed. The use of a meat
      thermometer is recommended. For easier carving, let meat stand in
      warm place 20 to 30 minutes before serving.

BROILING—Place meat on greased broiler rack. Broil steaks and chops two
      inches thick three inches away from source of heat. Cuts one inch
      thick should be placed two inches from heat. Cook until meat is
      nicely browned on top. Season and turn to brown other side. Season
      and serve at once.

PAN-BROILING—Preheat chicken fryer or skillet. Brown meat on both sides
      turning several times, if necessary. Pour off fat as it
      accumulates. Do not add water; do not cover. Test for doneness by
      cutting small slit next to bone. Reduce heat to finish cooking.

PAN-FRYING—Melt a small amount of fat in chicken fryer or skillet. Dip
      meat in flour or egg and crumb coating. Fry slowly until browned
      on both sides. Reduce heat to finish cooking, if necessary.

BRAISING—Brown meat slowly in hot fat in chicken fryer or saucepan. Meat
      may be dipped in flour before browning, if desired. Add a small
      amount of liquid. Cook at simmering temperature until tender.

STEWING—Cut meat into cubes; brown in hot fat in saucepan. Dredging with
      flour before browning is a matter of choice. Nearly cover meat
      with water. Cook, covered, at simmering temperature, until tender.
      Corned beef, ham, tongue, etc., are cooked in water to cover
      without preliminary browning.

NO SMOKE—Never heat fat to the point where it smokes. Keep heat low
      enough at all times to avoid smoking. For best flavor, brown meat
      slowly over moderate heat.

BEEF—Tender cuts of beef are cooked either rare, medium or well-done, by
      dry heat: roasting, pan-broiling or broiling. Less-tender cuts
      must be cooked to the well-done stage by moist heat (braising or
      stewing) in order to make them tender.

PORK—All pork cuts are tender but must be cooked to the well-done stage.
      Roasting is suitable for any of the larger cuts. Pork chops and
      steaks should be cooked by braising for best results.

LAMB—Roasting, pan-broiling, or broiling are suitable methods to use
      with lamb because all cuts are tender. The fell, the thin papery
      membrane which covers the lamb carcass, should not be removed
      before cooking. Lamb may be cooked rare, medium or well-done
      according to personal preference.

VEAL—All cuts need to be cooked slowly to the well-done stage in order
      to make veal tender. Veal may be roasted, braised or stewed. When
      an egg and crumb coating is used, chops and steaks cut ½-inch
      thick may be pan-fried successfully. (This must be done slowly

TIMETABLE FOR ROASTING

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

Poultry and all meat except pork is roasted at 325 degrees. Roast pork
at 350 degrees. Times given below are approximate, varying with size and
shape of roast. A meat thermometer is recommended for accurate
determination of degree of doneness.

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

Select a Standing Rib Roast. Place fat side up in Dutch Oven. Do not add
water; do not cover; do not baste. Roast in moderate oven, 325°F.

  Rare              18-20 minutes per pound
  Medium            22-25 minutes per pound
  Well-done         27-30 minutes per pound

For sure results use a meat thermometer. Insert it in the thickest part
of the roast, being sure that the bulb does not rest on fat or bone. Use
the time periods above as a guide. Remove the roast from the oven when
the thermometer reading is “rare,” “medium,” or “well-done,” as you
prefer.

                         PREPARING _Vegetables_


    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

When the natural color and flavor of vegetables are retained in cooking,
it generally follows that the maximum amount of food value is there,
too. Observe these three important rules for vegetable cookery if you
wish to get your money’s worth of vitamins and mineral elements.


1. Cook vegetables as quickly as possible.

Start vegetables in boiling water. When the vegetable is added, the
water stops boiling temporarily. Cover the pan and use high heat to
start the boiling again as quickly as possible. Then the heat may be
reduced, but the water should actually boil, not just simmer, throughout
the cooking process.


2. Use a minimum amount of water.

Half to ¾ cup of water is enough to cook four to six servings of most
vegetables in the 1-quart saucepan. Strong-flavored vegetables such as
onions, rutabaga and turnips are best cooked in water to barely cover in
an uncovered pan.


3. Utilize the cooking water.

Many of the important nutrients in vegetables are soluble in water. When
the cooking water is discarded these extra vitamins and mineral elements
go down the drain with it.

The most practical way to make use of the cooking water is to boil it
down and serve it as a sauce with the vegetable. After the vegetable has
been drained, boil the water rapidly until only two or three tablespoons
remain. Add a tablespoon of butter or margarine and pour over the
vegetable in the serving dish.

Water drained from potatoes is particularly good for use in gravy. In
the case of other vegetables, the flavor may not be compatible with that
of the meat stock. Small amounts, however, may be added to tomato juice
to be served as a cocktail.

SEASONING—Whether salt is added at the beginning of the cooking process
      or at the end is a matter of personal preference. It has no
      effect, one way or the other, on the food value.

TIMING—Cooking time will vary with the variety and age of the vegetable
      and the size of the pieces. In general, green leafy varieties such
      as spinach and new cabbage take 10 minutes or less. Allow about 15
      minutes for peas, asparagus, brussels sprouts, cauliflower,
      carrots and broccoli. The more fibrous, solid types like whole
      cauliflower or green beans take approximately 20 minutes. Root
      vegetables ... turnips, parsnips, potatoes, onions, beets, need 25
      minutes or more cooking.

VARIATIONS—Perfectly cooked vegetables need only a little salt and a dab
      of butter or margarine to enhance their flavor. Most cooks
      however, like to “dress up” vegetables occasionally for greater
      menu variety.

CREAMED—Carrots, broccoli, asparagus, snap beans, cabbage, onions and
      peas, alone or in combinations, are the favorites for creaming.
      Allow one cup of medium white sauce for two cups of cooked
      vegetable. Spinach is excellent creamed. Use ½ cup thick white
      sauce with two cups of the cooked greens. Season with a few drops
      of onion juice and a dash of nutmeg.

AU GRATIN—Turn creamed vegetables into greased casserole and cover with
      buttered crumbs or equal parts of grated cheese and crumbs. Brown
      in moderate oven, 350 degrees.

PAN-FRIED—Eggplant and summer squash are best pan-fried. Cut into slices
      ½ to ¾ inch thick. Sprinkle generously with salt and allow to
      stand about 15 minutes. Dip in flour. Fry in skillet in hot fat
      ⅛-inch deep. Brown on one side; turn to brown other side. Avoid
      turning more than once.

RING MOLD—Buttered spinach, mashed rutabaga or potatoes hashed in cream
      are attractive served this way. Pack the prepared vegetable into a
      greased ring mold. Unmold at once onto serving plate. Fill center
      with vegetable of contrasting color.

FROZEN VEGETABLES—Frozen vegetables are partially cooked by blanching
      before freezing. Therefore, the cooking time is shorter. Keep all
      frozen vegetables, except corn on the cob, frozen until ready to
      cook. Specific directions for cooking each vegetable are found on
      the package.

         HERE’S HOW YOUR STAINLESS STEELWARE SAVES FOOD VALUES


    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

STAINLESS STEEL, the most modern development in metallurgical science,
is wonderful for any type of cooking. America’s largest canneries, food
processors and the better restaurants cook and process food in stainless
steel utensils. Stainless steel not only preserves natural food flavors
... it is also easiest to keep sanitary and is immune to wear.

                                USE YOUR
                        STAINLESS STEELWARE FOR
                      HEALTHFUL WATER-LESS COOKING
                 (cooking with minimum amount of water)

The Water-Less way of cooking is highly recommended by leading health
and home economics authorities.

Heavy-weight Stainless Steel construction and seal-tight covers assure
perfect Water-Less cooking results. Meats and vegetables cooked the
Water-Less way (cooking with minimum amount of water) retain their
precious mineral elements and vitamins ... and this modern method also
preserves the natural flavors and color of the food.

fit into many dishes; adding extra food value or a fresh new touch to
