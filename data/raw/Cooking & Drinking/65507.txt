Molasses, a product of sugar cane, is a part of the American tradition
and has graced American tables since the days of the first colonists. It
played a very important role in the building up of the early commerce of
Colonial New England where it was and still is considered an everyday
food. In this part of the country, the molasses jug is as commonplace as
the salt and pepper shaker.

The wise buyer who wants the best of all molasses for every purpose will
study the many grades of molasses now on the market. These grades range
all the way from top-quality products with a smooth, rich, mellow
flavor, down to blackstrap, a low quality with a bitter “black” flavor.

The finest molasses is produced in the British West Indies where the
production of molasses is a major industry and is closely supervised by
the government.

From these islands and elsewhere the buyers of the American Molasses
Company select the best of each grade and by skillful blending and
careful aging produce Grandma’s Unsulphured Molasses with its sweet,
rich, and delicate aromatic flavor.

No molasses in which sulphur dioxide is used as a clarifying agent is
permitted to go into Grandma’s Molasses—the finest of all molasses
blends.

The quality of Grandma’s Unsulphured Molasses is the secret of its
delightful flavor. Pour some on a teaspoon—notice its rich, golden-brown
color—now taste it and enjoy its sweet, smooth flavor. Its purity is
guaranteed, for it is not bleached—it does not contain sulphur dioxide
or chemical preservatives of any kind. That’s why Grandma’s Unsulphured
Molasses is so different from ordinary molasses.

Grandma’s Molasses is an all-purpose molasses. Use it at the table over
waffles, on bread, or in milk. Use it in your favorite recipes. There’s
always a dish that calls for Grandma’s Molasses. From morning fruit and
cereal to dinner main dishes and desserts, you will find just the recipe
you need in this booklet.

The concentrated juice of sugar cane is the source of Grandma’s
Unsulphured Molasses. This high-quality molasses contains the natural
health-giving sugars and minerals squeezed from sun-ripened cane. The
cane juice is carefully concentrated to produce molasses of the finest
flavor and the most appetizing color.


SUGAR is needed—especially by active people—to supply heat and energy.
Grandma’s Unsulphured Molasses has a high sugar content. It contains
cane, dextrose, and levulose sugars. Grandma’s Molasses is a _natural_
sweet which can boast of more than energy value—it contributes zest and
extra nutritional values—that is why it is referred to as “nature’s most
nutritious sweetener.”


IRON is essential in the daily diet—for children and adults—to help
build red blood—to help prevent nutritional anemia due to lack of
iron—and to help build buoyant health.

Several foods are generally referred to as _especially valuable_ sources
of iron. Among these are molasses, liver, and spinach. Molasses is
several times richer in this mineral than is spinach and ranks near
liver in its rich iron content.

Grandma’s Unsulphured Molasses is a convenient and rich source of
nature’s iron.


CALCIUM is essential in the diet of people of all ages. It is especially
important for growing children and for pregnant and lactating mothers.
Calcium helps build strong bones and teeth and steady nerves.

Grandma’s Unsulphured Molasses is considered a fair source of this
important mineral.


VITAMIN B₁ is essential to good appetite and steady nerves. Molasses
contains some of this important vitamin.
