                           HUSBANDS LIKE BEST
                     _FROM SPRY’S RECIPE ROUND-UP!_




           _“Here they are—the 10 cakes husbands like best!”_
                                  says _Aunt Jenny_


    [Illustration: {Aunt Jenny}]

When I recently asked women to send me recipes for the cakes their
husbands like best, I expected to get a lot of good ideas. But I never
dreamed they’d arrive by the truckload! I’ve been simply snowed
under—thousands and thousands of wonderful recipes!

When all the recipes were sorted and listed, we had what amounts to a
real popularity poll. Certain kinds of cake proved to be “husbands’
favorites,” time and again, all over the country!


                          _They’re ALL hits!_

So we took the best recipes we could find for the ten kinds of cake
wives said their husbands like best. We checked them for easy making as
well as luscious eating ... and here they are! They’re tested, they’re
sure-fire and you’ll find they make the most delicious cakes any husband
could ever ask for.


                  _And all sure successes with Spry!_

Of course, since they’re Spry cakes, you’ll find they’re all higher,
lighter, better-tasting! For Spry is homogenized, pre-creamed to mix
more easily with dry ingredients. And Spry is the only kind of
shortening specially made to combine with the liquids your cake recipes
call for. That’s why your Spry cakes are so high ... so light ... so
velvety-textured. _You’ll_ bake a better cake, _be_ a better cook, with
Homogenized Spry.


                      _Which one will HE choose?_

And now you can run your own popularity poll—bake each one of these ten
beauties, and see which wins with HIM. Every one of them will win you
compliments, and among them he’ll find his favorite cake!

                            Now for the fun!


    [Illustration: _Frosting Tips_]

  _Here are the crowning touches—the simple, easy ways to add glamour
                             to your cakes_

Designing and executing a pretty decorative finish for a handsome cake
is pure fun—and certainly worth the trouble in the extra pleasure that
it gives. Do it when you won’t be disturbed and remember planning is
half the battle. If the plan is elaborate, draw it on paper first and
then mark the important spots with toothpicks set lightly in place after
the cake is frosted. They will serve as guides and insure even spacing.

Be sure cake is thoroughly cold (see inside back cover) before starting
to frost. Brush off loose crumbs and trim off over-browned or ragged
edges. Have decorations ready to use.


                          How to frost a cake

For layer cakes: Turn the bottom layer from the rack onto the cake
plate, bottom side up, and spread some of the frosting with a spatula
evenly over the surface. Top it with the second layer, bottom side down,
with edges even. Frost sides of cake first, using light up-and-down
strokes and bringing the frosting up and just over the top rim of the
cake. Pile the remaining frosting on top and spread out to rim, making
graceful swirls or soft ridges according to the type of frosting. With a
seven-minute frosting, attractive little peaks can be made by lifting
the frosting gently with a spatula. For certain types of decoration,
like lettering, a smooth frosted top is best. Avoid “puttering” with
frosting, as overworking ruins its appearance.

                            * * * * * * * *

For tube or loaf cake: Place cake top or bottom side up, as preferred.
Frost sides, then top, following suggestions for frosting layer cakes.


                       To adorn the frosted cake

For decorating, use good-to-eat ingredients, chosen to go with the cake
in color, texture, and character. Let the decorations be simple but
artistic and effective. For example, the ingredients commonly found in
the kitchen cupboard make beautiful decorations when used correctly.

Coconut—For an all-over sprinkle of coconut, use the canned moist
shredded coconut with long glistening white shreds. Pat it on while the
frosting is still soft. To tint, add a few drops of food coloring, then
rub between the palms of the hands to color it evenly. For a rainbow
effect, tint separate lots of coconut pink, green, yellow, and violet,
and then mix them. To tint and flavor, rub 1 cup coconut with 8 fine-cut
maraschino cherries or with the grated rind of 1 orange. For some cakes,
golden toasted coconut is effective.

To toast coconut, spread a thin layer in a shallow pan, toast in
moderate oven (350°F.) until a delicate brown, stirring often to toast
evenly.

                             * * * * * * *

    [Illustration: {decorated cake frosting}]

Chocolate—Striking effects can be obtained on a frosted cake with melted
chocolate (see directions for Chocolate Rapture Cake, p. 1). For
decorative dribbles or lettering, melt together over hot water ½ oz.
unsweetened chocolate and ½ teaspoon Spry. Cool before using. For enough
chocolate to cover the entire top of the cake and let it drip down the
sides in interesting icicle formations, double these quantities. Melted
chocolate can also be used for lettering as in “Happy Birthday”
treatment. White frostings or delicately tinted pink or green mint
frostings are especially pretty with melted chocolate decorations.
Halloween black cats or witches for the top of a frosted cake can be
made as follows: Draw or trace an outline of the desired shape on waxed
paper, fill in the outline with melted chocolate. Put in refrigerator to
harden, loosen from paper, and place on cake. Make other designs
similarly.

    [Illustration: {decorated cake frosting}]

A lacy filigree effect can be made on a white-frosted cake as follows:
Melt ½ oz. chocolate with ½ teaspoon Spry. Mark 5 circles around top of
cake and pour in chocolate. With a pointed knife, make 8 evenly spaced
strokes toward the edge of the cake, then between them make 8 upward
strokes toward the center, to get web effect (see illustration).

                            * * * * * * * *

Thin curls or shavings of sweetened or unsweetened chocolate make
interesting decoration. They can be made with a vegetable peeler or a
sharp knife. Semisweet chocolate bits can be used as push-ins on a soft
frosting to form letters or designs.

                            * * * * * * * *

Nuts—Use perfect walnut or pecan halves for making interesting patterns
on frosted cakes, pressing them in while the frosting is soft. Nuts can
be tipped or tilted into frosting with artistic effect. For making nut
borders, lines, or designs, cut the nuts in pieces; do not chop the nuts
as this makes unattractive “dust.” Brazil nuts can be “curled” by
softening them first in hot water, then cutting in very thin slices or
“curls.” Blanched almonds can be used for making patterns; sprinkles of
toasted slivered almonds are attractive on beige-colored frostings.
Sprinkling the sides of the cake with chopped nuts gives an attractive
finish.

Fruits and Peels—Fruits (canned, candied, dried, or fresh) can be used
endlessly. Maraschino cherries are especially good for Valentine,
holiday, or party cakes. Cherry halves can be cut to resemble hearts or
flowers, then placed around the rim of a frosted cake. Lengthwise cherry
slices can be arranged to form attractive poinsettias.

Pineapple can be tinted with food coloring, or cut up and arranged in
simple patterns with green citron; crushed pineapple, citron, and orange
peel can be used to make an unusual “flower lei” (p. 9). At
Christmastime, charming holly wreaths and Christmas trees can be
fashioned on frosted cakes with bits of red and green cherries and green
citron. Citron can be colored bright green with green coloring.
Streamers of fine-cut dates, figs, or raisins are pretty on some frosted
cakes, or definite patterns can be made with larger pieces if preferred.

Candies—Sprinkles of silver or gold dragées are beautiful on cakes with
fluffy white or pastel frostings. Dragées can be used to outline
interlocking hearts for a bridal shower, or to spell out “Happy
Birthday.” Gumdrops, cut in small pieces, can be sprinkled on a white
frosted cake for sparkling color, or arranged to outline a pattern like
a green shamrock for St. Patrick’s Day.

Lollipops, canes, all-day-suckers, or stick candy can be crushed and
used as gay color on the frosted sides and for lettering on top of the
cake. Contrasting colors are pretty.

Those round flat orange patties can be used as jack-o’-lanterns by
making little faces on them with melted chocolate and arranging them on
a chocolate frosted cake for Halloween. Chocolate candy animals standing
lightly on frosted cupcakes delight the children.

Tiny colored sugar flowers can be bought in the 5-and-10 cent store and
these are pretty arranged on cakes with fluffy white or pastel
frostings. For “extra-special” cakes you can buy candied violets or rose
petals to make wreaths of dainty flowers on a frosted cake.

You’ve probably had thoughts of your own as you were reading—of other
materials and other ways to use them. Go to it! Experimenting is half
the fun. Happy decorating!


                         Fancy Frosting Effects

These call for special tools, “boughten” or homemade, and special
frostings. Cake-decorating sets, consisting of a bag or “gun” and
assorted tubes can be purchased in housewares departments. They can be
used for making flowers, designs, or lettering on special-occasion
cakes.

If you haven’t a tube set, a paper cone for decorating can be easily
made. Just cut a 6” square of waxed paper and roll it into a cone. Spoon
in the frosting, filling the cone not more than half full. Fold down the
top edges and cut off the tip at the bottom to make a tiny opening for
the frosting to come through. Then take the cone in left hand, and grasp
its top with right hand, bringing thumb down to about the center.
Pressing down with the thumb forces the frosting down to the tip of the
cone and out through the hole, while your hand directs the movement of
the cone. With a little practice, lovely effects can be obtained.

The best frosting for this purpose is Ornamental Frosting because it is
very stiff, squeezes out ideally, and sets up firm on the cake.

Use ... for “greasing” cake pans, baking sheets, etc. Gives even, brown
      crust—prevents sticking.

Store ... Pan-coat in covered dish in cupboard for handy use—can be made
      ahead and stored till wanted. Need not be refrigerated.


                    How to tell when a cake is done

The cake recipes in this booklet specify a baking range in minutes
within which the cake should finish baking and be “done.” However,
before removing the cake from the oven, test it for doneness by touching
the top of the cake in the center lightly with finger. If the cake
springs back leaving no impression, the cake is done. Also, insert a
toothpick or wire cake tester in the center, and if it comes out clean,
the cake is done. If any dough adheres to the tester, longer baking is
needed.

    [Illustration: Cakes come out of pans readily with Spry Pan-coat (p.
    16) and proper cooling.]


                       Care of cake after baking

When cake has finished baking, remove it from the oven and put it on a
wire cake rack, in the pan. This permits circulation of air around it
and insures even cooling. Let it stand 10-15 min. Then gently loosen the
cake from the sides of the pan with a spatula or knife, working
carefully to avoid breaking edge. Place another rack on top of the pan,
turn over, and lift off the pan. Then turn cake right side up on rack to
finish cooling. When the cake is thoroughly cold, it is ready to be
frosted. For frosting recipes and frosting suggestions, see pp. 11-16.




            You can bake a BETTER Cake with Homogenized Spry


    [Illustration: Homogenized Spry]

Dip your spoon into Homogenized Spry—see how much lighter and fluffier
it is than other shortenings—how easy to work with. It’s pre-creamed,
easier to blend with dry ingredients. And Spry is the only kind of
shortening that is specially made to mix with the liquids your cake
recipes call for. So you can see why Spry, with this special
blending-action, makes any cake a better cake. You can count on it every
time—you’ll bake a better cake, be a better cook, with Homogenized Spry.
