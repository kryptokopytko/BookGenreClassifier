  Pecan
  Recipes

  Revised




There aren’t many Texans who don’t have a special liking for pecans
grown in the state, usually enjoying them straight from the shell. But
now, more and more people are incorporating pecans in many different
types of recipes. In this booklet we have included recipes for salads,
main dishes, desserts, candies, and cookies.

The Texas pecan industry has grown significantly from the days when
the nuts were gathered by the family and hauled to town to sell during
the season. Today, modern storage facilities and packaging make them
available year-round. And if purchasers store pecans properly, they
will retain their fresh flavor and quality for very long periods.

We hope that you find new ways to use pecans in cooking and that you
insist on Texas pecans when you shop.

Buy Fresh Texas Pecans


The pecan is the state tree, and quite properly it is named. It was a
source of food for the Indians as well as the early colonists who found
the trees growing on creek and river banks. With new varieties and
commercial cultivation, the pecan orchards of Texas provide a steady
supply of pecans during the harvesting season from October through
December.

During these months, shoppers can find fresh pecans in retail outlets
and can also purchase from growers themselves in many areas. Pecans
are native to 152 counties in Texas and are grown commercially in the
central part of the state, down on the western border, and in the
Trans-Pecos.

Check with local farm organizations for names of producers of Texas
pecans in your area.




Storage

=When stored properly, they retain good taste and high quality.=


Whether you buy a small cellophane package of shelled pecans or a
five-pound bag of in-shell pecans, the best place to store them is in
the freezer. Pecans can spoil quickly under warm temperatures, but will
keep fresh one year at 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

Pecans do not have to be thawed before being added to a recipe. Even
if they are not part of a cooked dish, they will thaw adequately
before serving. Also, portions unused can be returned to the freezer
without any loss of quality. During the holiday season, keep the pecans
refrigerated--even in-shell--until they are ready to be served.

Transcriber’s Notes

Page 5: In the original recipe for meat loaf, “1/2 C. milk” was
repeated twice.

A few minor adjustments were made to improve consistency in formatting.

The loaf pan size for White Fruit Cake was 2 4 inch x ½ in the original
and has been left this way, although we are not aware of any pan of
that size.
