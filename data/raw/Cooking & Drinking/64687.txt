GUACAMOLE DUNK
(_Yield: 12 Party Servings_)

  1 ripe avocado
  ½ cup chopped cucumber
  ¼ cup chopped onion
  1 3-oz. package cream cheese
  2 tablespoons lemon juice
  ½ teaspoon salt
  Dash of Tabasco sauce
  1 teaspoon paprika

Mash avocado meat and blend in finely chopped cucumber and onion. Add
cheese and seasoning; beat until smooth and fluffy. This can be piled
into cucumber boats for attractive serving. Bank boats with SALTINE
CRACKERS, TOWN HOUSE CRACKERS and CLUB CRACKERS. To make cucumber boats,
cut in half lengthwise; scoop out meat; chop and use in this recipe.


SHRIMP CANAPES
(_Yield: 12 Party Servings_)

  1 pound cooked shrimp
  ¼ cup minced scallions or onions
  4 tablespoons mayonnaise
  2 hard-cooked eggs, chopped
  ¼ teaspoon salt
  ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
  ½ teaspoon paprika
  ½ cup Parmesan cheese

Chop or grind shrimp and blend in scallions, mayonnaise, eggs and
seasoning. Heap on TOWN HOUSE CRACKERS and sprinkle with cheese. Broil 5
minutes at 350° F. or until delicately browned.


CHEESE AND ANCHOVY RAREBIT
(_Yield: 18 Party Servings_)

  3 cups grated sharp Cheddar or Swiss cheese
  2 tablespoons melted butter
  2 teaspoons salt
  2 teaspoons dry mustard
  1 teaspoon paprika
  2 cups medium white sauce or
  1 cup dry white wine or
  1 cup beer
  ½ cup chopped anchovy filets

Put cheese and seasoning in top of double boiler or chafing dish; add
butter. Stir constantly until melted, then blend in slowly one of the
three liquids suggested. When mixture is smooth (about 10 minutes) fold
in anchovy filets. Sprinkle top with chopped chives. Keep hot during
serving in chafing dish or over candle warmer. Have plenty of SALTINE
CRACKERS, TOWN HOUSE CRACKERS and CLUB CRACKERS nearby for dunking in
this tasty rarebit.

SERVING APPETITE TEASERS in the living room before dinner is becoming
increasingly popular. Variety in CRACKERS, and their crispness and
freshness, add so much to the tastiness of spreads. Today delicious
prepared spreads are available at food stores. Wise homemakers keep an
assortment on the pantry shelf.


MYSTERY CHEESE BALL
(_Yield: 50 Party Servings_)

  5 5-oz. jars Blue cheese
  1 5-oz. jar sharp Cheddar cheese
  1 tablespoon grated onion
  2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
  1 cup finely chopped nuts

For easier blending allow cheeses to stand at room temperature at least
2 hours. Put all ingredients, except nuts, into a bowl and mix until
smooth and velvety. Electric mixer will make it easier but can be done
by hand. Refrigerate in well greased small bowl until firm. Remove from
bowl; shape into ball; roll in nuts. Place on chop plate; bank CLUB
CRACKERS and TOWN HOUSE CRACKERS all around.

TIPS ON TEASERS will make you a “talked about hostess.” Tasty hors
d’oeuvres include TOWN HOUSE CRACKERS, CLUB CRACKERS and SALTINE
CRACKERS spread with ham, chicken, tuna or egg salad. Crackers topped
with cheese and anchovies, miniature hamburgers, franks or sausages can
be served hot from the broiler.

A tray of radishes, pickles, olives, celery hearts and carrot sticks; an
arrangement of apple and pear wedges, glazed grapes and banana chunks
dipped in sour cream and rolled in colored cocoanut will enhance the
beauty of the buffet table. A crystal bowl of punch could be placed at
one end of the table and a silver tea service, for those who want
coffee, at the other. Prepare ahead; add finishing touches just before
guests arrive—then you’ll have fun at your own party!

CREOLE BEAN CHOWDER
(_Yield: 8 Servings_)

  1 lb. dry red beans
  8 cups water
  1 cup grated carrots
  1 cup finely chopped onion
  1 #2 can tomato puree
  2 teaspoons sugar
  4 whole cloves
  ½ teaspoon pepper
  3 cups water
  1 #2 can okra
  1 cup finely chopped celery
  1 tablespoon salt
  4 tablespoons vinegar
  ½ teaspoon Tabasco sauce
  ½ cup margarine
  ½ teaspoon chili powder

Wash beans well. Place in large utensil with lid. Cover with the 8 cups
water; soak overnight. Cook, covered, until tender (about 3 hours).
Drain and save liquid. Then run beans through ricer or Foley mill.
Return to liquid and add all other ingredients. Cover and simmer for one
hour. If desired, 5 minutes before serving add 3 franks sliced very thin
and diagonally. Serve with Parmesan Wafers (see recipe below).


MENU SUGGESTION:

To prepare Parmesan Wafers, mix together ¼ cup Parmesan cheese, ½
teaspoon garlic salt and just enough soft butter to spread. Cover TOWN
HOUSE CRACKERS with a generous amount of this spread and place on a
cookie sheet. Broil until bubbly and well browned (about 6 minutes at
350° F.). Serve piping hot. Creole Bean Chowder is so delicious and
filling, that it can be used for the main dish of the meal, if
complemented by a salad and dessert. Try serving it with creamy cole
slaw and delicious Pecan Pie (page 29).


POTATO POTAGE
(_Yield: 6 Servings_)

  2 cups diced potato
  1 teaspoon salt
  1½ cups boiling water
  6 strips bacon, cut fine
  ½ cup chopped onion
  1 cup milk or cream
  ¼ teaspoon pepper
  ½ teaspoon paprika

Cook potatoes in salted boiling water until tender. Fry bacon until
crisp; remove from fat; then saute onion until yellow. If possible, use
green onions including tops. Mash potatoes, reserving liquid. Combine
potatoes, liquid, onion, bacon, cream and seasoning; let simmer 10
minutes. Serve with SALTINE CRACKERS spread with onion butter, sprinkled
with paprika and broiled 5 minutes at 350° F. A salad made of two parts
shredded red cabbage and one part shredded carrot, a bit of green pepper
and mayonnaise is a perfect accompaniment for POTATO POTAGE. Top it all
off with Ginger Spice Cake piled high with Apple Frostie (page 34) and
you’ll have a delicious Sunday night supper!

THERE’S A DIFFERENCE IN SOUPS, when they are made with loving care and
caressed by the touch of genius. Really good soups demand time for
preparation and skill in seasoning. The writer, Thomas Fuller, once
said, “Love has its charms, but only soup so well nourishes the young,
stokes the fires of manhood and comforts the old.” The recipes given in
this chapter are guaranteed to please the entire family. Remember—always
serve hot soups very hot and cold soups chilled thoroughly.

Soup and crackers go together like ham and eggs, cream and sugar, salt
and pepper, love and marriage—you can’t have one without the other!
Crackers to complement rich flavorful soups must be very crisp. We
suggest tempting touches be added to crackers and that they be served
crisp and crunchy straight from the oven!


VICHYSSOISE—COLD AND QUICK
(_Yield: 6 servings_)

  3 medium potatoes
  ½ cup potato water
  1 8-oz. carton sour cream
  ¾ cup half and half (cream)
  ⅓ cup chopped chives or green onion
  ½ teaspoon salt
  dash Tabasco sauce
  1 can beef consomme

Wash, peel and dice potatoes. Cook until tender. Pour off liquid and
measure; reserve up to ½ cup. Mash potatoes, combine with potato water,
sour cream and cream. Whip until smooth. Add chives, seasoning and
consomme; blend well. Refrigerate at least 4 hours. Serve in soup bowls
or cups, sprinkle with paprika and chopped chives. Serve with TOWN HOUSE
CRACKERS spread with anchovy paste and broiled 5 minutes at 350° F.
Complement with a salad of sliced avocado and cucumber on endive and
Raspberry Parfait Pie (page 30).


PEAS PORRIDGE HOT
(_Yield: 6 servings_)

  5 strips of bacon
  ½ cup chopped onion
  2 cans pea soup
  1 can boiling water

Fry bacon until very crisp; remove from fat and saute onion until clear.
Blend fat and onion into soup. Pour in pan and add boiling water slowly,
stirring until smooth. Cook until it bubbles up 2 minutes. Add bacon
crumbled into bits. Serve piping hot with TOWN HOUSE CRACKERS topped
with Blue cheese and broiled 5 minutes at 350° F.

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

SOUP’S A MEAL when served with a tasty salad and tempting dessert. A
tossed green salad with tomato wedges will complement PEAS PORRIDGE HOT.
For the ideal dessert, try Graham Cracker Cake with Pine-Cot topping
(page 33).


LOBSTER BISQUE
(_Yield: 6 servings_)

  2 cups milk
  2 cups light cream
  ½ can tomato soup
  3 tablespoons butter
  1 cup chopped lobster meat
  4 tablespoons flour
  ½ teaspoon salt
  ½ teaspoon onion salt
  ½ teaspoon celery salt
  ½ teaspoon red pepper

Combine and heat milk, cream and soup. Saute shredded lobster meat in
butter; add flour; cook until absorbed by lobster. Combine lobster with
hot tomato and cream combination; add seasoning. Cook slowly, stirring
constantly until thick. Serve with CLUB CRACKERS generously buttered,
sprinkled with paprika and toasted 8 minutes in a 350° F. oven.
Delicious with avocado slices and grapefruit sections with horse-radish
dressing.

SERVING TRICKS. The French excel not only in their cuisine, but in the
art of serving. They believe every dish should be a masterpiece—rich in
flavor, skillfully seasoned; served with ceremony! They never serve
large portions; when you finish, you’ll wish there were a bit more. That
is the state of “Perfection”! Never detract from the appeal of food by
serving too much.

“Savory Soups” given here are culinary masterpieces—so flavorful—so
skillfully seasoned the most discriminating French chef would say, “Oui!
Oui!” We suggest they be used as the main dish around which to build a
meal, but in small portions are delicious at a dinner. Each of our
“Savory Soups” is so delicious you’ll find yourself serving them often
once you’ve been tempted with a taste!

being sure it touches crust all around. This gives egg whites something
to hold onto while browning.
