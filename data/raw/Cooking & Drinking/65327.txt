                  _Nutritive Value of Cottage Cheese_


Cottage cheese is a concentrated form of milk. One pound of cottage
cheese contains most of the protein, calcium, phosphorous, iron, and
vitamins found in three quarts of milk.

Three ounces of cottage cheese furnishes about 50% of an adult’s daily
requirement for calcium.

Cottage cheese is a complete protein (builds, repairs, and maintains
body tissue); therefore, it is particularly desirable for growing
children and is an ideal food for adults.

Cottage cheese is easily digested and readily assimilated. It is an
important food for the person desiring to lose weight because of its
high nutritive value and low caloric content. One ounce of creamed
cottage cheese supplies about 30 calories.

In addition to its concentrated food value, cottage cheese is also a
very versatile food. It can be served in a variety of tempting ways
because it combines nicely with almost any type of food.
