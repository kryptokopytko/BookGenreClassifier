                                 APPLES
                          _in appealing ways_


Choose your favorite apple—a fragrant Winesap, a juicy Stayman, a tart
Northern Spy ... each variety has its own appeal. And the versatile
apple can lend flavor to your main course, salad, bread, or dessert.

An apple, eaten raw, makes a pleasant, low-calorie snack or dessert. A
medium-size apple contains only 70 calories.

Like other fruits, apples contain some vitamins and minerals. Bottled or
canned apple juice may be fortified with vitamin C.

In this publication, you’ll find useful facts about apples, recipes for
many of your favorite apple dishes, and some new or unusual ways of
preparing and serving apples.




                            CHOOSING APPLES


The large assortment of apples at retail markets provides a variety for
every need. It’s a good idea to learn to recognize some of the most
popular varieties. (See table, p. 4.)


                               Varieties

There are many good all-purpose apples, plus others especially suited
for preparing in certain ways.

Apples that “go to pieces” when cooked are usually best for applesauce;
those that keep their shape are best for baking whole. Tart apples are
good for cooking; sweeter apples, for eating raw. Early summer apples
are especially good in applesauce and pies because they’re likely to be
juicy, tart, and quick-cooking.


                           Quality of Apples

Be sure to buy good-quality apples. Those that are mature when picked
have the best flavor and texture. They should be firm and crisp, have a
good color, and be free from defects.

Most apples are marketed by grade, and many retail packages show
variety, grade, and size. U.S. grades for apples are U.S. Extra Fancy,
U.S. Fancy, U.S. No. 1, and combinations of these grades. U.S. No. 2 is
a less desirable grade. Apples from the far western States are usually
marketed under State grades which are similar to Federal grades.

Fresh apples and other fruits can develop bruises, blemishes, or other
defects because of poor growth or rough handling. They are sometimes
available at bargain prices.

    Tart, firm Rome Beauty is a classic choice for dishes such as baked
    apples that call for apples that retain their shape when cooked. The
    recipe is on page 11.]




                             STORING APPLES


Only perfect apples should be stored for later use. Use apples with
bruises, skin breaks, or decayed spots as soon as possible.


                             Brief Storage

Store slightly underripe apples for 2 weeks or less in a cool place, 60°
to 70° F., to ripen.

Apples that are ripe enough for eating will keep in your home
refrigerator for a week or longer. Place them in the humidifier
compartment or in a moisture-resistant container, such as a polyethylene
bag. Fruit needs some ventilation, however. The polyethylene bags in
which apples are sometimes purchased have small holes. If you prepare
your own bags for storing apples, cut a few scattered half-inch holes.


                             Longer Storage

Most varieties of apples will keep several months if stored at lower
temperatures. Freezing will lower the quality of apples.

For directions on long-term storage of apples, see Home and Garden
Bulletin 119, “Storing Vegetables and Fruits in Basements, Cellars,
Outbuildings, and Pits.” Send your request on a post card to the Office
of Information, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C. 20250.

                                RECIPES


Here are some of the many ways to use apples—in the main course of the
meal, in salads, in breads, in desserts, and in other ways. Let the
table on page 4 guide you in selecting the best apple variety for each
recipe. The flavor, texture, and juiciness of the finished product may
vary slightly with the kind of apple used.

Commercially canned applesauce was used in developing the recipes that
call for applesauce. If you use homemade applesauce in these recipes, it
should be similar in sweetness and juiciness to commercially canned
applesauce.

Raw apples may darken when the cut surface is exposed to air, especially
if the fruit has touched the iron in a knife blade or chopper. Protect
cut apples from darkening by mixing with fruit juice—lemon, orange,
grapefruit, or pineapple—before adding other ingredients.

boned fresh pork shoulder with 1 teaspoon salt and pepper, as desired.
