The recipes in this book demonstrate the basic principles of making all
types of pies successfully. In addition, some of the recipes show how
the use of Pet Evaporated Milk helps make better cream, custard, and
chiffon pies—at lower cost.

Since Pet Milk is homogenized milk concentrated to double richness, it
is an ideal ingredient for these pies. It takes the place of whipping
cream in chiffon pies, is used as milk in the other types—and, in all
cases, combines rich flavor, creamy texture, with increased milk
nourishment.

In some recipes, too, double-rich Pet Milk takes the place of butter. In
others, it replaces the eggs usually called for ... with perfect
results.

No other form of milk can guarantee such delicious results when used as
an ingredient in pies. Yet Pet Milk costs less generally than any other
form of whole milk.

                      TO MAKE TENDER FLAKY PASTRY


❶ Measure all ingredients accurately.

a. Flour should be sifted before measuring; then spoon lightly into cup
      and level off with straight edge of knife. Be careful not to pack
      flour down  by shaking or tapping cup.

b. To measure shortening accurately, pack into measuring cup and level
      off with straight edge of knife.

❷ Cut in half of shortening until mixture looks like coarse meal. This
gives _tenderness_ to the crust. Cut in remaining shortening until it is
the size of large peas. This gives _flakiness_ to the crust.

    [Illustration: 2.]

❸ Sprinkle water (a tablespoon at a time) over mixture. Mix lightly with
fork until flour is moistened. Use only enough water to make all of
flour mixture stick together when gently pressed with fork, and “clean
the sides” as it moves around the bowl. Shape dough into a smooth ball.

❹ Sprinkle flour over board or pastry cloth, using only enough to
prevent dough from sticking. Roll with quick, light strokes, working
outward from the center to the edge, keeping crust as round as possible.
Without turning dough, roll out pastry completely on one side to ⅛ inch
thickness. If edges tear, overlap, then roll lightly over the mended
spot to seal. Invert pie pan on dough and cut 1½ inches from rim around
pan. This insures enough dough to fit into pan without stretching.

    [Illustration: 4.]

❺ Fold the dough in half and lift carefully into the pan. Smooth bottom
with finger tips; lift edge and ease in sides. Stretching causes crust
to shrink during baking. Trim so that dough extends about ½ inch beyond
edge of pan. Fold extra dough under until even with pan rim. To flute,
press dough between thumb and forefinger of one hand and forefinger of
the other.

❻ If you use a pastry mix, follow directions on package. Break the mix
up slightly if it has become packed in container. Follow tips (see next
page) when rolling out and placing crust into pie pan.




                     TIPS ON BAKING PERFECT PASTRY


Choose pie pans of oven proof glass for a well-baked, browned
undercrust. Shiny metal does not bake the undercrust as well because it
reflects the heat. Aluminum pans with satiny finish also give good
results.

For a baked pastry shell:

    [Illustration: a.]

a. Pierce all over with fork to permit air to escape and prevent
      blisters.

b. Cool thoroughly before pouring in desired filling.

c. Bake on shelf slightly above center in 425 (hot) oven 12 minutes, or
      until brown.

For two crust pies:

a. Cut several slashes in top crust to let steam escape or top crust
      will puff up leaving a hollow space underneath.

b. Fold edge of upper pastry under lower edge before fluting to keep
      juices from boiling out.

Use a 450 (extremely hot) oven for the first 10 to 15 minutes to brown
the crust and then turn temperature down to 325-350 (moderate) for
remainder of cooking time.

                          GRAHAM CRACKER CRUST


  Mix together     1¼ cups fine graham cracker crumbs[1]
                   ⅓ cup melted butter or margarine
  Press firmly with back of spoon in bottom and on sides of 9-inch pie
  pan. Chill until needed.


[1]Sixteen 2½-inch crackers will make 1¼ cups crumbs.




                     TIPS ON MAKING FLUFFY MERINGUE


1. Use large fresh eggs and let the egg whites warm to room temperature
before beating them.

2. Spread meringue on pie filling to edges of crust. Then the meringue
won’t pull away from the crust as it bakes.

3. Bake meringue at 400 on center rack of oven for 7 to 8 minutes.

4. Meringue should be cooled slowly. A draft causes meringues to shrivel
and form little beads of syrup on top.

5. Meringue will not stick to knife, if knife is dipped into water
before cutting pie.




                       MERINGUE (See tips above)


  Turn on oven and set at 400 (hot).
                                8-INCH PIE           9-INCH PIE
  Beat until stiff but not dry  2 egg whites         3 egg whites
  Beat in gradually             4 tablespoons sugar  6 tablespoons sugar
  Spread on top of desired pie filling. Bake on center rack of oven for 7
  to 8 minutes at 400 or until light brown. Cool thoroughly before serving.
