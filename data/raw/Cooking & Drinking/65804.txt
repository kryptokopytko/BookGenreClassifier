                      Electric Cooking in General


    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

1. Q. Do I Have to Learn to Cook All Over Again to Cook with
      Electricity?

  A. Of course not! Just use your same favorite recipes (and many
  others) with confidence and ease—the only difference will be that your
  electric range will give you greater simplicity and accuracy, and add
  greater joy to cooking because it is cleaner, cooler and automatic.

2. Q. Is Cooking by Electricity Expensive?

  A. In most sections of the country electrical cookery is no more
  expensive than other methods, often less expensive. In fact most
  modern electric ranges as produced by reliable manufacturers are
  designed and engineered for economical operation.

3. Q. Approximately How Much Does It Cost an Average Family to Operate
      an Electric Range?

  A. Reproduced here is a table giving approximate electrical cooking
  costs compiled from the experience of electric range users in all
  parts of the country.

     Electric Cooking Rate In Your     Number of People in the Family
      Locality (Per Kilowatt Hour)

                                           2     3     4     5     6
                                    1c  $.56  $.72  $.84  $.95 $1.02
                                   1¼c   .70   .90  1.05  1.19  1.28
                                   1½c   .84  1.08  1.26  1.43  1.53

                                    2c  1.12  1.44  1.68  1.90  2.04
         2¼c (Ave. Elec. Cooking Rate)  1.26  1.62  1.89  2.14  2.30
                                   2½c  1.40  1.80  2.10  2.38  2.55
                                   2¾c  1.54  1.98  2.31  2.61  2.81
                                    3c  1.68  2.16  2.52  2.85  3.06

4. Q. Is It Expensive to Pre-heat Such a Large Oven?

  A. No. It costs approximately 1¼c to pre-heat a large electric oven to
  the average baking or roasting temperature—(350°F) and much of this
  heat is conserved during baking or roasting by the oven insulation.
  Actually, the current is on only a part of the time that the oven is
  in use.

5. Q. What About the Safety of an Electric Range?

  A. All reputable electric ranges are inspected, tested and approved by
  the Underwriter Laboratories for fire and casualty hazards and must
  comply with their rigid standards. As a matter of general practice and
  recommendation of manufacturers, frames and all non-electrical parts
  are grounded to insure against becoming electrically alive while in
  use. All electrical parts are shielded and insulated to protect
  against accidental contact.

6. Q. Can Cooking be Continued with Safety During an Electrical Storm?

  A. Yes, completely. Due to the reasons of safety mentioned above.

7. Q. What Happens if a Switch Is Turned On and Left On By Mistake?

  A. Current will be wasted, that’s all. The oven cannot overheat
  because automatic controls prevent this. The surface units can be left
  on at high speed for days without damage to the unit or without
  hazard.

8. Q. Is There Any Hazard Involved By Leaving the Electric Oven
      Operating During My Absence?

  A. No. You can place an entire meal in the oven and leave the house
  for the afternoon, and the range will automatically cook the dinner
  and turn off the heat at the proper time if the range is equipped with
  an automatic time control. Should you arrive home later than planned
  the oven will have retained sufficient heat for a reasonable length of
  time to keep the dinner warm enough for immediate serving.

9. Q. What Happens if Power Failure Occurs?

  A. Experience indicates that power failures are negligible. And, even
  should they occur, there is no danger from the electric range. Only
  the inconvenience of being without the use of the range during the
  period the power is off.

                 Surface Cooking on the Electric Range


    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

1. Q. Do the “Definite” _Surface_ Heats Provided by Most Electric
      Ranges, Have Any Advantages Over the “Infinite” Number of Surface
      Heats Provided by Ranges Using Other Fuels?

  A. Yes. This is important because it eliminates “guesswork” in cooking
  and enables you to use even unfamiliar recipes with confidence and
  ease. The heat obtained at each switch setting will be repeated
  exactly each time you use it.

2. Q. How Many Surface Heats Should be Provided for Best Results?

  A. Most ranges have five surface heats described here, and these have
  been found adequate for every cooking need.

3. Q. What Is the Use for Surface “High” Heat?

  A. “High” heat is always used to bring foods quickly to steaming
  point. (As soon as cooking temperatures are reached one of the lower
  heats is used to continue and complete that cooking.) It is used to
  preheat fat for frying and used continuously for deep fat frying of
  potatoes. “High” heat is always used for speed in heating water.

    [Illustration: _High_]

4. Q. What Is the Use for the Surface “Medium-High” Heat?

  A. “Medium-high” provides the right temperature for frying chicken or
  browning meats and for maintaining cooking of large quantities of food
  in extra large utensils. “Medium-high” on small units can be used for
  baking griddle cakes when a small utensil is used.

    [Illustration: _Medium High_]

5. Q. When Do You Use the Surface “Medium-Low” Heat?

  A. “Medium-low” is just right for percolating coffee or for heating
  small quantities of food quickly.

    [Illustration: _Medium Low_]

6. Q. How Is “Low” Heat Used?

  A. “Low” heat is used for keeping foods cooking after they have been
  started on “high” heat. This low heat is sufficient for keeping quite
  a large quantity of vegetables and other foods actively cooking.

    [Illustration: _Low_]

7. Q. How Is “Simmer” Heat Used?

  A. “Simmer” heat is used for low temperature cooking, for instance,
  small quantities of vegetables, cooking custards, sauces and dried
  fruits. The uses for “low” and “simmer” heats are much the same
  excepting “low” is used for larger quantities of foods.

    [Illustration: _Simmer_]

8. Q. Why Is Low Water Cooking Recommended for Vegetables?

  A. Because more food value is retained, also flavor and appearance is
  better. Very little water need be added to vegetables to create the
  necessary steam for proper cooking.

9. Q. Which of the Five Surface Heats Is Most Practical to Use in Making
      Coffee?

  A. “Medium-low” on either the large or small unit, depending upon the
  size percolator and amount of coffee to be made.

10. Q. Is the Deep Well Cooker More Practical Than a Fourth Surface
      Unit?

  A. Yes, because the deep well cooker will perform virtually any
  cooking operation possible on a surface unit, plus baking, and do many
  of them better and more economically.

11. Q. What Types of Food Are Best Prepared in the Deep Well Cooker?

  A. Pot roasts, soups, stews and any foods requiring long cooking
  times.

12. Q. What Are Some Uses for the Deep Well Cooker?

  A. Steaming puddings, baking, simmering dried fruits and cooking
  tougher cuts of meats. As a utensil it can be used for sterilizing.

13. Q. Do Flavors Mingle When Several Foods Are Cooked at One Time in
      the Deep Well Cooker?

  A. No—If you will remember to do one thing—always remove the foods
  from the cooker as soon as the current is turned off. While foods are
  cooking they are “exhaling” their odors. When they begin to cool they
  begin to “inhale” and absorb the odors of other foods.

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

14. Q. Can the Deep Well Cooker Be Used for Steaming Brown Bread,
      Puddings, etc.?

  A. Yes, by pouring water in the bottom of the cooker and using a
  “trivet” or rack.

15. Q. Can the Deep Well Cooker Be Used for Baking?

  A. Yes. It is economical for baking several potatoes, cup custards or
  baked apples. When the cooker well is used for baking the cooker
  utensil is removed and a rack placed in the well. The well is heated
  to proper baking temperature with the switch on “high” and baking is
  continued on “low” heat.

16. Q. How Can the Deep Well Cooker Be Used as a Warming Oven?

  A. Remove the utensil. Place the rack in the well and cover with the
  lid of the cooker. “Low” heat provides sufficient heat for warming.

17. Q. Can the Deep Well Cooker Utensil Be Used on the Surface Unit?

  A. Yes.

18. Q. Does Food Cook as Fast in a Deep Well Cooker?

  A. Yes. It is ideal for soups, stews, pot roasts, etc., which require
  uniform low temperatures over longer periods for best cooking results.

19. Q. Why Are Deep Well Cookers Usually Insulated?

  A. Many foods prepared in the deep well cooker are those requiring
  long cooking periods. Because of adequate insulation less current is
  used. For example, the insulation on deep well cookers makes it
  possible to prepare an entire meal at a total current cost of less
  than two cents. (Based on an electric cooking rate of two-and-a-half
  cents per kilowatt.)




                     Using the Electric Range Oven


    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

1. Q. How Long Does It Take to Preheat the Electric Oven for Baking?

  A. From seven to fifteen minutes is usually required for preheating to
  a temperature of 350°F. (In one make of Range, two units provide
  correct baking heat and fast preheating to _400°F_ in _less_ than
  seven minutes.)

2. Q. How Can the User Determine When the Oven Has Reached the
      Temperature She Desires for Baking or Roasting?

  A. This is easily determined by the oven signal light which goes out
  when the oven reaches the desired temperature.

3. Q. Is It Necessary to Preheat the Electric Oven for Baking?

  A. No, however, for time-saving the oven should be preheated.

4. Q. Should the Oven Always be Preheated for Oven Meals?

  A. This depends on the type of oven meal. For example, there are many
  combinations of foods which can be placed in the oven and remain there
  several hours before cooking is started and which do not require
  preheat. Other types of oven meals require cooking immediately as soon
  as they are prepared and better results are obtained from a preheated
  oven.

5. Q. If Four Baking Pans Are Put Into an Electric Oven at One Time, How
      Should They Be Placed to Allow for Even Heat Distribution?

  A. The pans should be placed so they are not touching each other, or
  any part of the oven. Since this usually means using two shelves, the
  pans should be staggered, so one is not directly above the other.

6. Q. Why Is It Not Necessary to “Peek” Into an Electric Oven During
      Roasting or Baking?

  A. Because with accurate electric controls, much of the uncertainty of
  cooking has been eliminated. Even if the recipe that you are using is
  questionable, do not “peek” until the required baking time has passed.

7. Q. Why Do You Recommend Roasting in an Open Shallow Pan Without the
      Addition of Water?

  A. A shallow pan allows the heat from the oven to contact the food
  more directly. With the even penetration of heat, meat will cook more
  uniformly.

8. Q. Why Is There So Little Shrinkage and “Drying-out” of Meats Cooked
      in an Electric Range?

  A. Because electricity does not require additional air for fuel
  combustion, there is no excess air circulation to absorb moisture and
  carry it out of the oven.

9. Q. How Does an Oven Clock Control Work?

  A. Simply set the automatic clock control at the time you want the
  current to go on and at the time you want the cooking operation to
  stop. Set the thermostat at a given temperature and the range will
  automatically perform the desired cooking operation.

10. Q. Are All Ranges Equipped With Time Clocks Automatically
      Controlling the Oven Operation?

  A. No. This is a feature usually included as standard equipment on
  higher priced models. It can be added as an accessory to many of the
  lower priced models.

11. Q. Is It Possible to Operate an Electric Range Oven at Low
      Temperature, Such as 200°F?

  A. Thermostatic controls are capable of operating at temperatures as
  low as 150°F. on practically all electric ranges.

12. Q. What Is the Maximum Temperature at Which Electric Range Ovens Can
      Be Automatically Controlled?

  A. Nearly all electric ovens will heat to 550°F. This is above
  required baking temperatures, yet it avoids danger of burning foods
  which would of course be possible at higher temperatures. The
  thermostat is always set at this maximum temperature when broiling is
  done to avoid having the broiling unit cut off during the cooking
  operation.

13. Q. What Is the Advantage of Having the Oven Vent Open on the Front
      of the Back Panel?

  A. First, you can place the range flush against the wall without
  damaging the wall paper or curtains. Second, the top vent prevents
  moisture from collecting in the top of the oven. Accordingly the
  housewife is assured that cakes baked on the upper shelf will not be
  soggy but will turn out as beautifully browned as those baked on lower
  shelves. Third, no flue pipe is necessary.

14. Q. Why Do Most Electric Ovens Have Shelf Type Doors?

  A. This type of door cannot sag, as do swing doors, thus creating
  drafts of cold air within the oven. Also, they serve as a convenient
  shelf in placing pans in, or taking them out of the oven.

15. Q. Can the User Depend on an Electric Oven Thermostatic Control?

  A. The hydraulic type control is so designed that the bulb can be
  placed in the desired oven position to insure accurate temperatures
  while the control knob can be located in that position which is most
  convenient for the user.

16. Q. Does the Automatic Oven Control Increase Economy for Electric
      Range Users?

  A. Yes. By providing no more heat than is needed to maintain the
  required temperature this control avoids waste of electricity.

17. Q. Some Electric Ranges Have Two Units for Heating the Oven. Others
      Only Have One. What Is the Essential Difference?

  A. First, two units give a greater degree of flexibility and a more
  even distribution of heat throughout the oven. Also, they allow the
  use of the upper unit for broiling in a more convenient position. The
  single unit oven is not as convenient because broiling is done on the
  lower part of the oven and it lacks the type of heat distribution made
  possible by two units.

18. Q. Does the Electric Oven Give Off Much Heat in the Kitchen During
      Baking or Roasting?

  A. Because electric heating elements require no air supply for
  combustion, the oven is completely insulated on all six sides, thus
  giving off practically no heat.

19. Q. Should the Broiler Pan Be Heated Before Broiling Is Started?

  A. No. A hot broiler pan is many times responsible for excess smoking
  because of fat drippings from the meat striking the hot broiler pan.

20. Q. How Is Broiling Speed Regulated?

  A. Broiling speed is regulated by raising or lowering the position of
  the broiler pan in the oven. For fast broiling, place on oven shelf
  located close to heating unit. This will produce results very similar
  to charcoal broiling. For lower temperature or slower broiling, lower
  the oven shelf so that top surface of food will be 2½ or 3 inches from
  the broiling unit, and allow slightly more time for broiling.

21. Q. Are Broiler Meals Popular?

  A. Yes. Much of the original flavor is retained in the food by this
  method of cooking. For example, meat and fruits may be placed on the
  broiler pan and cooked. The vegetable can be placed in the pan below
  the broiler rack. The cooked vegetable will be heated while the food
  on the rack is broiled.

22. Q. Is It Advisable to Use the Broiler Pan for Roasting?

  A. Yes, the broiler pan is a convenient utensil for use in roasting.

23. Q. For Best Results, Should Frozen Meats Be Entirely Defrosted
      Before Cooking?

  A. Acceptable cooking results may be obtained either way. However, if
  meat is allowed to thaw, cooking time can be judged more accurately;
  also thick steaks broil more uniformly if allowed to thaw. Meat to be
  thawed may be placed on the shelf of your household refrigerator
  without removing the wrapping.

  If it is more convenient to cook without thawing, the meat should be
  cooked for a longer period of time than usual at a slightly lower
  temperature. A thick steak cooking from the frozen condition may
  appear cooked, but actually be cold and raw in the center. Generally
  meats that are cooked from the frozen condition should be cooked half
  again as long as thawed meats, and sometime longer. It isn’t easy to
  figure cooking time, the length of time will depend, of course, upon
  the kind of meat and whether you want it rare, medium or well done.
  See the charts on pages 23 and 24 for a guide in cooking frozen foods.




                     Utility of the Electric Range


    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

1. Q. Are All Electric Ranges Equipped With a Warming Drawer?

  A. No. It is usually a regular feature on deluxe models and can be
  installed as an accessory on some other models.

2. Q. Are the Temperatures in the Warming Drawer Harmful to China?

  A. No. The temperature is sufficient for warming china but not high
  enough to cause any harm.

3. Q. Are the Warming Drawer Temperatures Adequate for Keeping Food Warm
      for Serving?

  A. Yes. A common practice is that of placing fresh baked rolls in the
  warming drawer for serving during the dinner period.

4. Q. Do All Ranges Have Storage Space for Cooking Utensils?

  A. Most do. Some models of course offer more storage space than
  others.

5. Q. Are Hot Pans Harmful to the Porcelain of the Work Surface of the
      Range?

  A. Yes. Sliding hot pans from the cooking unit to the porcelain work
  surface may result in scratches. An inexpensive pad may be used to
  protect the work surface.

6. Q. Will the Porcelain Surface of the Range Be Harmed By Large Pans
      Which Extend Over the Unit and Contact Directly?

  A. Yes. A good example of this is a large pressure cooker. The
  recessed bottom on some pressure cookers has caused considerable
  damage to the porcelain cooking top on ranges because the heating unit
  does not come in contact with the pressure cooker resulting in
  excessive temperatures adjacent to the surface unit. When such
  utensils must be used, it is well to raise the unit from the surface
  to insure direct contact.

  One make of Range has available a metal ring which slips in under the
  unit and raises it about 1 inch to prevent damage to the porcelain
  top.




                       Care of the Electric Range


    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

1. Q. Why Is It Easy to Keep Electric Ranges Clean?

  A. First, electricity is the cleanest of all fuels. Second, one piece
  ovens eliminate cracks and provide round corners—work surfaces with
  coved backs and cooking units that are easily removed for cleaning.
  Porcelain in itself is one of the easiest of all surfaces to clean.

2. Q. What Is the Best Way to Clean the Outer Surface of an Electric
      Range?

  A. First, let porcelain finished surfaces cool before cleaning.
  Second, wipe up spots as soon as possible. If porcelain is warm, use a
  dry cloth, never a wet one. Third, when porcelain is cool, wipe with a
  damp soapy cloth, rinse and dry well. Do not use gritty soaps or acid.

3. Q. Are There Any Precautions That Should Be Used in Cleaning an
      Electric Range?

  A. Yes. First, see that all switches are “Off.” Second, do not use
  abrasives or other cleaning materials that will scratch. Third, do not
  immerse electrical units in water. If these units become damp in
  cleaning, be sure that they are dry before connecting. Fourth, do not
  clean surface units while hot. Fifth, always soften hardened foods
  before removing as unnecessary scraping may damage any type of
  surface.

4. Q. What Is the Best Way to Clean the Oven?

  A. Always be sure the current is turned off and the oven is at least
  partially cooled. The interior is more easily cleaned with a damp
  cloth before the oven is entirely cooled. Be sure to remove shelves
  and heat units first and put them in a dry place. Wipe out the inside
  of the oven with a cloth wrung from soap water, rinse and dry well.
  Fine steel wool may be used to remove any food particles adhering to
  the surface. Spillovers which occur during baking or roasting may
  involve a little more difficulty in cleaning. If so, a cloth saturated
  with water to which household ammonia has been added may be placed
  over the soiled surface of the oven or “baffle” and allowed to remain
  for 20 minutes or an hour. Burned-on material may then be more easily
  removed by a cloth or fine steel wool without damaging glossy surface.

  Caution: Do not use the oven repeatedly after a spillover. This causes
  continual burning on of the food particles making them more difficult
  to remove, and in time will cause some damage to the glossy surface.

5. Q. What About Cleaning Under the Electric Range?

  A. This is seldom necessary. However, if it is, remove the lower
  utility drawers which gives access to the floor space below. If a
  thorough cleaning is desired, the range can be moved away from the
  wall where there is a long enough cord, or where it can be
  disconnected.

6. Q. What Happens When Hot Grease Spatters Out of the Frying Pan on to
      the Electric Range?

  A. Nothing. After cooking has been completed and the surface units
  have had time to cool completely, wash the surface with soap and
  water, rinse, and dry well. Note: If spattering occurs in excess
  during frying, you are using heat too high for this type of cooking
  operation. Review again the suggested heats for the different cooking
  operations on the surface units.

7. Q. What Is the Best Method of Cleaning the Broiler Pan?

  A. The broiler pan and rack should be washed just as any of your other
  cooking utensils. Place in water immediately after using and apply
  steel wool to any food which cannot be removed easily.

8. Q. Should the Surface of the Range be Waxed to Protect the Porcelain?

  A. No. Thorough cleaning and drying is the best protection you can
  give to that glossy porcelain.

9. Q. Is It Necessary to Place the Range Some Distance from the Wall to
      Prevent Soilage of the Paper?

  A. No—in fact the range can be placed as close to the wall as desired
  because oven vents are usually on the back panel and open towards the
  front, eliminating danger of soiling from the oven.

10. Q. How Are Spillovers Cleaned from the Surface Units?

  A. Most surface units are of the fully enclosed type and can be
  cleaned by merely brushing them off occasionally. The ring around the
  units should be cleaned with a damp cloth and soap powder.

11. Q. What Happens if Foods Spill Over on the Surface Unit?

  A. Nothing. They are caught by the reflector and the drip tray causing
  no damage to the unit. Wiring is so protected that no electrical
  problems are involved.

12. Q. How May the Drip Tray Be Cleaned?

  A. The drip tray which is located directly below the surface cooking

                  COOKING Guide for Frozen Vegetables


The cooking time for vegetables will vary somewhat, depending on
variety, state of maturity and how it has been prepared for freezing
(sliced, quartered, or whole). The following table is simply a guide to
help you in determining cooking time, based on one pound quantity,
cooked in covered utensil, starting in boiling water.

1. Frozen vegetables may be cooked without thawing. However, if they are
allowed to defrost partially, the frozen block can be easily broken up,
resulting in more even cooking. Complete thawing of vegetables before
cooking is not recommended.

2. Use covered cooking utensil—measure ½ to 1 cup of water, or enough to
cover bottom of utensil to depth of ⅛ to ¼ inch.

3. Start all vegetables on high heat in boiling water. Reduce heat when
active steaming is regained.

4. Keep all utensils tightly covered.
