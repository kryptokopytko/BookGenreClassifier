                    HOW TO COOK IN CASSEROLE DISHES

                    “_Some hae meat and canna eat,
                    An’ some wad eat that want it,
                    But we hae meat an’ we can eat,
                    Sae let the Lord be thankit._”


There is no doubt that the fashion of cooking in casseroles or
earthenware dishes has come to stay in this country; and it is hardly a
matter of surprise when the advantages of this form of cookery are
really understood, whether it be actual casserole cookery, so called, or
cookery in fireproof utensils.

Cooking “en casserole” is a term which signifies dishes cooked and
served in the same earthenware pot or utensil, though, as every one
knows, the original French word is the generic name for a stewpan or a
saucepan.

The old idea of a casserole was some preparation of chopped fish, flesh,
or vegetables enveloped in a crust of cooked rice, macaroni, or potato.
Properly speaking, however, a casserole is a dish, the material for
which in many instances is first prepared in the sauté or frying-pan and
then transferred to the earthenware pan to finish cooking by a long,
slow process which develops the true flavors of the food being cooked.

The sooner the casserole utensil becomes an indispensable part of our
kitchen outfit the better, for it makes in every way for
economy,—economy of materials, time, and labor,—as materials often too
tough for ordinary cooking may by this means be served in a nutritious
and tender condition. When casserole cookery is thoroughly understood,
many combinations of food and many inexpensive viands will be put to use
and very palatable results obtained.

Casseroles nowadays take on all shapes and sizes, from the dainty
individual dishes up to a size sufficient for serving a large number of
persons.

Of late years the prices of these utensils have been reduced so greatly
that they are within the reach of the most modest housewife’s
pocketbook, and then at the same time the actual pots and fireproof
dishes have been improved enormously in quality.

Every kind of utensil can be had in this ware nowadays, and people are
realizing how delicious food cooked in this way is.

They may be bought at all the reliable house-furnishing stores.
Ornamental effects in brown, green, blue, red, white, or yellow
stoneware add to the appearance of the breakfast, luncheon, or dinner
table. No one attempts to deny that the eye has much to do with the
palate, and that a dish served in an attractive form is likely to prove
much more pleasing to the taste than a carelessly offered one. The
holders in which the casseroles are placed when removed from the oven
and taken to the table are made of silver, nickel, brass, copper, and
wrought iron, and are examples of genuine artistic merit.

For those who do not wish the extra expense of the metal holder a
platter or tray will answer the purpose, which is simply to keep the hot
casserole from coming in contact with the table or table mats and
scorching them. The adaptability of a stoneware cooking utensil deserves
to be more fully known, when it will be more thoroughly appreciated.

For braising, pot roasting, as well as stewing, which are slow cooking
processes, the casserole has proved its superiority over the metal pans
again and again. It gives its best and almost exclusive service in the
baking oven, for poultry done in pot roasting fashion or for stewing
fruit, and other articles which require to be cooked slowly under close
cover. There are few cooks who do not know that the application of a
moderate, even heat for certain food materials produces far better
results than if quick heat is applied. For such cases the use of
earthenware cooking utensils is to be strongly recommended, because by
their aid an application of heat, such as will insure gentle simmering,
steaming, or baking, is assured.

The casserole may be regarded as a labor-saving device, taking the place
of a half-dozen pots and pans in the kitchen.


             SOME COMMENDABLE FEATURES OF CASSEROLE DISHES

(1) The initial cost of the utensils is very low, and if proper care is
bestowed on them they may last as long as metal pans.

(2) All risk of metallic contamination is avoided. The ingredients may
be put together in a casserole and allowed to stand for hours in it
before cooking without spoiling in the very least degree. Its lining
cannot scale, and in cooking the contents cannot become tainted or
discolored.

(3) The ornamental appearance of casserole dishes simplifies the
practice of serving the viands at table in the vessels in which they
were cooked, so great a desideratum in cases where the prosperity of a
dish depends upon its hot service. The troublesome process of re-dishing
can in most cases be dispensed with. This is convenient as well as
economical.

(4) Casseroles are readily cleaned on account of their perfectly hard
and unbroken surfaces. It can easily be seen when casseroles are clean.
They are sanitary, and food prepared in them is pure and sweet. They do
not retain any taste whatever from previous cooking. Therefore the same
utensils can be used for the most varying preparations.

(5) The cooking in casserole dishes is slow but thorough, and all the
nutritious elements in the viands are preserved in their integrity. The
cover must fit snugly to each utensil, to prevent too rapid escaping of
the aromas and flavors. Sometimes a strip of cloth, spread with a soft
paste of flour and water or mashed potatoes, is pressed over the joining
of the casserole and the cover, and the heat of the oven finishes the
sealing of the dish. When the dish is ready to serve, the strip of cloth
and paste is removed.

(6) The use of a casserole is economical. The actual cooking is effected
slowly and evenly, consequently less fuel is used in cooking. Once the
materials have been started on their culinary way they require little
attention. A casserole dish may be placed in the oven or on the stove;
it may be used for steamed food or as a chafing dish.

(7) The cleanliness and wholesomeness of a casserole make it especially
valuable in preparing food for the invalid and the convalescent.

(8) In the cooking of fruits and vegetables, especially for canning, the
casserole is invaluable. The earthenware is not attacked by fruit acids,
therefore cannot give rise to any noxious product.

(9) Any dish which requires slow, gentle cooking can be prepared in a
casserole, and hash, curry, and other réchauffés are far superior in
flavor when recooked in earthenware than in metal. The stew, or whatever
it is, may be left to get cold in the casserole. The color would be
spoiled if this were done with an ordinary saucepan.

(10) The flavor of the food cooked is brought out best when it is
prepared in an earthenware dish.

(11) The fact that a casserole is a non-conductor of heat makes it more
economical to use than other ware.

(12) The amount of water, liquid, or stock in which the article is to be
cooked should be relatively small, and, in general, seasoned. For stews,
ragouts, etc., it is better to cook the meat in a nicely seasoned sauce,
that it may absorb the flavor in cooking. The time, in general, should
be multiplied by two; that is, if the recipe calls for thirty minutes;
cook in the casserole in the oven for about sixty minutes. The heat of
the oven should be about 212 degrees Fahrenheit or less, that the liquid
in the casserole may simmer, not boil.

When vegetables are to be cooked—and nearly all vegetables are
wonderfully better when cooked by this method—a small amount of water,
in many cases seasoned stock, should be used.

(13) Left-overs, salads, and small entrées of all kinds may be served in
a most attractive manner in ramequins or individual casseroles.

(14) The crowning advantage of casserole cooking, especially in a family
where for one cause or another meals are apt to be irregular, is that
the dish can be kept waiting for a considerable time without
deterioration. Food can be left in a casserole with perfect safety as
long as desired.


                    HOW TO CARE FOR CASSEROLE DISHES

The cook who has been accustomed to the use of iron, granite, copper,
aluminum, or other metal cooking utensils will necessarily have
something to learn when adopting earthenware. It must be realized that
it is a method of slow cookery, and cannot be hurried. Before being used
for the first time the vessels should be soaked in cold water for some
hours, as this will go far toward saving them from cracking on their
first exposure to heat. There need be little risk of this if the heat be
applied gradually, and this principle should always be observed;
although as the utensils become seasoned by constant use the risk of
accident is materially lessened. In many places garlic is considered
indispensable, the new dishes being rubbed with a clove of it, “to
prevent their cracking.” Never place the vessels on the stove or within
the oven without either water or fat in them. Never put a casserole
roughly on a metal surface, especially if it is full or partly full.

Sudden alternations of temperature should be avoided, that is to say,
the casserole should not be taken off the range or out of the oven and
placed in cold water or on the wet sink, and vice versâ. A fierce heat
is never needed or desirable.

If the cooking is done on an ordinary coal range the fire holes should
be kept closed and the heat received through the top lids; if a gas
range be employed, the gas jets should be kept low, and not allowed to
flare round the utensil. When cooking is being done on the top of the
range with wood, coal, gas, or oil as the fuel, an asbestos mat placed
underneath will modify the heat. The asbestos mat may also be used in
the oven. If the heat must be intense for other food in progress of
cooking at the same time as an earthenware dish is in the oven, the heat
may be controlled by placing the casserole in a pan of hot water which
can be lowered in temperature by occasional supplies of cold water added
to the hot water.

The adoption of these simple precautions will make easy the use of
earthenware utensils. Marmites, ramequins, cocottes, au gratin dishes,
and soufflé cases all come under the head of casseroles.

                              BAKED LIVER

 1 lb. calf’s liver
 3 heaping tablespoonfuls bread crumbs
 1 teaspoonful chopped parsley
 ¼ teaspoonful powdered herbs
 1 chopped onion
 Salt and pepper to taste
 Sliced bacon
 ½ pint (1 cup) water

Cut the liver into slices one-third of an inch thick, wash and dry
thoroughly, lay it in a well-buttered casserole.

Make a forcemeat with the bread crumbs, chopped parsley, herbs, chopped
onion, salt and pepper to taste, cover each strip of liver with this,

                           BAKED VIRGINIA HAM

 1 Virginia ham
 ½ pint (1 cup) sherry wine
 A few cloves
 Brown sugar

Wash the ham and place it in cold water; let it soak for twelve hours,
then put it into fresh cold water and let it soak for another twelve
hours. When ready to cook, place it skin down in a large casserole,
which must be of good size and full of cold water. It will take about
one hour, over a moderate fire, to come to boiling point.

Then keep it boiling steadily—on no account must it be allowed to boil
fast—and as the water boils down replenish with hot, never with cold,
water, so as not to check the boiling.

When the ham is done it will, on its own accord, turn over skin up. This
is sufficient proof of its being thoroughly cooked without further test.
Let it cool in the liquor in which it was cooked. Take it out, gash the
entire top, having the gashes about half an inch apart. Stick cloves in
the gashes, sprinkle thickly with brown sugar, and pour over all the
sherry wine.

Lay the ham in a fireproof dish and bake till brown.

and then the sausage. Sprinkle in the remaining flour and chopped
parsley. Cover with water, put on the lid, then cook slowly for two and
a half hours.

To make the bread stuffing: Put into a saucepan one heaping
tablespoonful of butter and fry in it one chopped onion; then add one
cupful of bread crumbs, one cupful of stock, one teaspoonful of salt,
half a teaspoonful of pepper and thyme, one tablespoonful of chopped

keep the lid on the dish, and let it cool.

 1 teaspoonful whole peppers

Take the onions, remove the outer skin with the fingers and the second
skin with a silver knife, throw them into salt water, allowing them to
remain for twenty-four hours. Then put them on the fire in an
earthenware pan with fresh salt water and let them come to a boil.
Remove from the fire, pour off the water, put the onions into a large
stoneware jar, and pour over the hot vinegar, which has been previously
scalded, with the spices. When spices are used, they should be put into
a small cheesecloth bag and thrown into the vinegar; this obviates the
necessity of straining.

put the juice and the purée into an earthenware pan and boil for five
minutes, stirring all the time, then let it drain through a napkin
stretched out as for jelly straining; weigh all that remains on the
napkin, and for each pound of pulp allow one pound of sugar. Put the
sugar into a pan with half a pint of water, let it dissolve, and cook it
till it reaches 236° F., or the “small ball” (_i. e._, on dipping the
finger and thumb first into cold water and then into the syrup, and
again into cold water, the sugar from the fingers forms a small ball),
keeping it well skimmed; then add the tomato pulp and half a cupful of
red currant juice for every pound of the pulp.

Place on the fire and stir continuously till it reaches 220° F.; then
let the preserve cook for three minutes more and pot in the usual way.

                              ASPIC JELLY

 1½ ozs. (3 heaping tablespoonfuls) powdered gelatine
 1¾ pints (3½ cups) water or stock
 4 tablespoonfuls white vinegar
 4 tablespoonfuls tarragon vinegar
 1 sprig parsley
 2 bay leaves
 1 blade mace
 4 cloves
 12 whole white peppers
 1 inch cinnamon stick
 Rind and juice 1 lemon
 1 level teaspoonful salt
 1 small carrot
 1 small onion
 1 small turnip
 1 stalk celery
 6 drops kitchen bouquet
 Whites and shells of 2 eggs

Put the gelatine into a clean cold saucepan, add the water or stock,
then the vegetables, cleaned and cut into small pieces; add all the
other ingredients, and whisk over a gentle heat until boiling. Remove
the beater, allow the thick white scum to rise to the top of the pan,
draw to one side of the stove, cover, and allow to stand ten minutes.
Pour two quarts of boiling water through a jelly bag, then the jelly.
Turn the jelly into a wet earthenware mold and use as required when set.

Aspic jelly lends itself to a great variety of useful dishes. It is used
in cold entrées where the materials are molded in the jelly, which means
that the aspic must be beautifully clear and of firm consistence.


                             BOILED HOMINY

 ½ pint (1 cup) hominy grits
 2 pints (4 cups) boiling water
 Salt to taste

Have the water boiling in a fireproof dish, stir into it the hominy,
adding salt to taste. Cook slowly for three hours or longer, stirring
frequently. If the hominy is soaked overnight, one and a half hours
boiling in the morning will suffice.

Cook in the same manner.


                          CANDIED CRANBERRIES

 Cape Cod cranberries
 Sugar
 Water

For this recipe use the Cape Cod cranberries, half as much sugar as
berries, and half as much water as sugar. Wash and pick over the berries
and lay them in a deep casserole; put the sugar on the top like a crust,
and the water on the top of that.

Cook very slowly.

When they just come to boiling point, cover for just a few moments—not
long or the skins will burst—then uncover and simmer until tender. Take
up carefully and spread on oiled plates to dry.

These candied cranberries may be used in place of cherries for
decorating cakes or candies.


                              CHOUX PASTRY

 2 ozs. (2 heaping tablespoonfuls) butter
 ½ pint (1 cup) water
 4 large eggs
 ¼ teaspoonful salt
 ¼ lb. (1 cup) flour

Put the butter into a fireproof dish, add the water, bring to the
boiling point, quickly add the flour and salt, stir well with a wooden
spoon until the mixture leaves the sides of the pan, remove from the
fire, allow to cool, but not become cold; add the eggs, beating each one
in thoroughly.

Set away in a cool place for one hour.

Put into a forcing bag with a plain tube and force on to a greased
baking tin into small rounds; brush over with beaten egg, and bake in a
hot oven for half an hour.

When cold, split them open at one side and fill them with whipped cream
sweetened and flavored to taste.

The mixture may be forced in small pieces into a pan of smoking hot fat
and fried like doughnuts. They should then be sprinkled over with sugar.


                           CORN-MEAL SOUFFLÉ

 ½ pint (1 cup) corn meal
 1 pint (2 cups) hot milk
 ¼ teaspoonful salt
 5 eggs

Cook the corn meal, either yellow or white, in the hot milk in a
casserole until well thickened, stirring frequently; remove from the
fire, add the salt, then beat in the yolks of the eggs one at a time,
add the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs. Bake in a moderate oven until
light and nicely browned—it takes about forty-five minutes.

Serve at once from the baking dish, either with butter or meat gravy.


                          MINCE MEAT FOR PIES

 1½ lbs. seeded raisins
 2 lbs. chopped apples
 1 lb. Sultana raisins
 1½ lbs. currants
 ½ lb. chopped citron peel
 ½ lb. chopped candied lemon peel
 ½ lb. chopped candied orange peel
 1½ lbs. (3 cups) sugar
 ½ lb. blanched chopped almonds
 1 teaspoonful salt
 1 lb. finely chopped suet
 3 oranges, grated rind and strained juice
 3 lemons, grated rind and strained juice
 1 tablespoonful powdered cinnamon
 1 tablespoonful grated nutmeg
 1 tablespoonful powdered mace
 1 tablespoonful ground cloves
 1 tablespoonful powdered allspice
 1 tablespoonful powdered ginger
 ½ pint (1 cup) sherry wine
 ½ pint (1 cup) best brandy

Put all these ingredients into a large earthenware jar, mix well, and
stir up before using. Keep well covered. The mince meat ought to be made
at least one month before required. The fruit should all be cleaned very
carefully.


                            OATMEAL PORRIDGE

 Oatmeal
 Water
 Salt

Put an earthenware dish on the stove, allow one cupful of water to each
person. When the water boils, sprinkle in the oatmeal with the left
hand, stirring briskly all the time. Use one handful of meal to each cup
of water; stir free from lumps. Let the oatmeal boil for a quarter of an
hour before adding salt to taste; cook the oatmeal for at least one
hour, stirring occasionally. If poured in plates, these should be
previously warmed. Serve with milk.

Any stewed fruit is also a nice accompaniment, and good for the health.

Another method is to mix the meal with cold water, stir steadily until
it boils, add salt as in former recipe, and cook also for one hour.

Serve in the same way.

Still another way. The night before it is wanted mix up the oatmeal with
milk, one handful of oatmeal to one cupful of cold milk, add a little
salt, pour into an earthenware jar, and let it soak all night. In the
morning set the jar in a pan of boiling water, and let it steam for
three hours, or longer if time permits.

When cooked this way serve with stewed figs.


                                 PASTRY

 ¾ lb. (3 cups) flour
 ½ lb. (1 cup) lard
 ¼ teaspoonful salt
 1 gill (½ cup) ice water

Mix the flour and salt together in an earthenware bowl, then mix in the
lard by cutting it in with a knife. Add the ice water, and mix as little
as possible. Roll the pastry out on a floured baking board.

It should be handled as little as possible.


                              PUFF PASTRY

 1 lb. (4 cups) flour
 1 lb. (2 cups) butter
 1 egg yolk
 1 tablespoonful lemon juice
 Cold water

Wash the butter in cold water and squeeze it in a floured towel into a
flat cake. Sift the flour into an earthenware basin, rub two heaping
tablespoonfuls of the butter finely into it. Beat up the yolk of the egg
with the lemon juice and a little cold water, add them gradually to the
flour and butter, making them into a firm paste. Roll out the paste into
a long strip, lay the butter on one end of it, wet the edge slightly,
and fold the paste over. Fasten the edges well together, turn round,
press with the rolling pin, and roll out lengthways; have the paste so
that the two open edges are parallel with yourself after folding it in
three. Roll from you and never from side to side, using gentle pressure.
Then fold in three. Now put the paste to cool for twenty minutes—the
friction will have heated it somewhat. Then arrange the paste with the
open ends in front of you and again roll out lengthways and fold in
three as before. This completes the second rolling.

Repeat for the third and fourth time, then put to cool for another
twenty minutes. After this, in like manner, give the fifth, sixth, and
seventh rollings, and again cool for twenty minutes. The paste is now
ready for the final rolling out.

Before giving the last two rollings sprinkle over it a few drops of
lemon juice; each time when rolling the pastry keep all the edges as
square as possible.


                              SUET PASTRY

 ½ lb. (2 cups) flour
 4 heaping tablespoonfuls chopped suet
 1 teaspoonful baking powder
 Cold water
 ¼ teaspoonful salt

Sift the flour, salt, and baking powder into an earthenware bowl, rub
the suet well into them, then make into a stiff paste with cold water,
adding it gradually.

This paste may be boiled for two hours in a cloth or mold, or rolled out
and used for fruit, sweet or savory puddings, or roly-polys.


                            TOAD IN THE HOLE

 ½ lb. (2 cups) flour
 ½ teaspoonful salt
 1 lb. link sausages
 2 eggs
 1½ pints (3 cups) milk

Sift the flour and salt into a basin; beat up the eggs well, and after
mixing them with the milk, pour gradually on the flour, beating it well
with a wooden spoon. When quite smooth, pour it into a well-buttered
fireproof dish; skin the sausages and lay them in the batter, and bake
in a moderate oven for three-quarters of an hour.

Pieces of apples, rhubarb, prunes, or pieces of cold meat or fish may be

The fruit requires a little sugar, and sugar must also be served along
with the pudding.


                       TO PEEL AND GRATE A LEMON

To peel a lemon for flavoring just remove the yellow skin with a sharp
knife, taking care to take none of the white pith.

To grate a lemon take a grater, and grate off the yellow part only, the
white being of no use for flavoring, besides being very indigestible.

A small brush is excellent for removing the rind from the grater.

so as to keep their color.

                       TO MAKE BROWN BREAD CRUMBS

Take the crusty part of some stale bread, put it into a moderate oven to
dry, and bake a golden brown shade; crush with a rolling pin or in a
mortar, pass through a fine sieve. These may be kept for a long time if
