food management and recipes

[Illustration Styled chicken and food scale]


Whether you are just learning the skills of food management and
good cooking or are an experienced hand in the kitchen, this
booklet—prepared by USDA food and nutrition scientists—can serve you
well.

It combines good eating and good nutrition. It packs the results of
years of food and nutrition research into a ready handbook for everyday
use. It tells how to get the nutrients you need from a variety of
foods—then translates this knowledge into taste-tested recipes and
well-balanced meals.

Feeding your family well takes less time and work than it used to.
Today’s foods can have built-in convenience. Meals can be more varied
because more food choices are available.

       *       *       *       *       *

NUTRITION....

Food At Work For You


Nutrition is the food you eat and how the body uses it.

People differ in how much they want to know about nutrition, but
everyone needs to know a few facts about food and health as a basis for
selecting the foods to eat.

You need food to get energy for work and play, to move, to breathe,
to keep the heart beating—just to be alive. Children and youths need
energy from food for growth.

Food also provides a variety of substances—nutrients—that are essential
for the building, the upkeep, and the repair of body tissues, and for
the efficient functioning of the body.

Everyone needs the same nutrients throughout life but in different
amounts. Proportionately greater amounts are required for the growth
of a body than just for its upkeep. Boys and men need more energy and
nutrients than girls and women. Large people need more than small
people. Active people require more food energy than inactive ones.
People recovering from illness need more than healthy people.

You and your family can get all the nutrients you need from foods, but
no one food contains all the nutrients in the amounts required for
growth and health. Only a variety of different kinds of foods will
supply all you need.


A guide to eat by

Nutrition scientists have translated knowledge of the nutrient needs of
people and the nutritive values of foods into an easy-to-use guide for
food selection.

This Daily Food Guide, on pages 4 and 5, sorts foods into four groups
on the basis of their similarity in nutrient content. Each of the broad
food groups has a special contribution to make toward an adequate diet.

Here are some of the reasons different food groups are emphasized in
the guide and the names of some of the nutrients these foods provide.

Meat, poultry, fish, and eggs from the _meat group_ and their
alternates—dry beans, dry peas, and nuts—are valued for their protein.
This is needed for the growth and repair of body tissues—muscle,
organs, blood, skin, and hair. These foods also contribute iron and the
B-vitamins—thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin.

Vegetables and fruits from the _vegetable-fruit group_ are valuable
sources of vitamins and minerals. In the guide, this group is counted
on to supply most of the vitamin C and a large share of the vitamin A
value in the diet. Choices are directed toward the citrus fruits and
some other foods that are among the better sources of vitamin C; and
toward the dark-green and deep-yellow ones for vitamin A value.

Vitamin C is needed for healthy gums and body tissues. Vitamin A is
important for growth, normal vision, and a healthy condition of the
skin and other body surfaces.

Foods from the _milk group_ are relied on to meet most of the calcium
needs for the day. Milk is the leading source of the mineral calcium,
which is needed for bones and teeth.

Milk also provides protein, riboflavin, vitamin A, and many other
nutrients. Cheese and ice cream also supply these nutrients, but in
different proportions.

The _bread-cereal group_, with its whole-grain and enriched bread and
other cereal products, furnishes important amounts of protein, iron,
several of the B-vitamins, and food energy.

Fats, oils, sugars, and sweets are not emphasized in the guide because
they are common in every diet. Some of the fats and oils provide
certain of the vitamins, and some furnish essential fatty acids, but
the chief nutritional contribution of these foods is energy value.


How to use the guide

Homemakers who follow the guide will find it flexible enough to use in
choosing foods for families.

Food choices within the groups are wide enough to allow for a variety
of everyday foods. Meals can be planned to include family favorites,
foods in season, and foods to fit the family budget.

The size of servings can be suited to the needs of family members—small
servings for children and for those wanting to lose weight; extra large
servings (or seconds) for very active adults, teenagers, and those
wanting to gain weight. Pregnant and nursing women also need more food.

Foods from the Daily Food Guide fit easily into a three-meals-a-day
pattern of eating. Foods from each group often appear in each meal—but
this isn’t essential. The important thing is that the suggested number
of servings from each food group be included sometime during the day.

Many people want and need more food than the minimum servings suggested
from the four food groups. To round out meals and satisfy appetites,
you can include additional foods from the four groups as well as other
foods not listed in these groups.


_A Daily Food Guide_


MEAT GROUP


_Foods Included_

Beef; veal; lamb; pork; variety meats, such as liver, heart, kidney.

Poultry and eggs.

Fish and shellfish.

As alternates—dry beans, dry peas, lentils, nuts, peanuts, peanut
butter.


_Amounts Recommended_

Choose 2 or more servings every day.

Count as a serving: 2 to 3 ounces of lean cooked meat, poultry, or
fish—all without bone; 2 eggs; 1 cup cooked dry beans, dry peas, or
lentils; 4 tablespoons peanut butter.


VEGETABLE-FRUIT GROUP


_Foods Included_

All vegetables and fruits. This guide emphasizes those that are
valuable as sources of vitamin C and vitamin A.


_Sources of Vitamin C_

_Good sources._—Grapefruit or grapefruit juice; orange or orange juice;
cantaloup; guava; mango; papaya; raw strawberries; broccoli; brussels
sprouts; green pepper; sweet red pepper.

_Fair sources._—Honeydew melon; lemon; tangerine or tangerine juice;
watermelon; asparagus tips; raw cabbage; collards; garden cress; kale;
kohlrabi; mustard greens; potatoes and sweetpotatoes cooked in the
jacket; spinach; tomatoes or tomato juice; turnip greens.

_Sources of Vitamin A_

Dark-green and deep-yellow vegetables and a few fruits, namely:
Apricots, broccoli, cantaloup, carrots, chard, collards, cress, kale,
mango, persimmon, pumpkin, spinach, sweetpotatoes, turnip greens and
other dark-green leaves, winter squash.


_Amounts Recommended_

Choose 4 or more servings every day, including:

 1 serving of a good source of vitamin C or 2 servings of a fair source.

 1 serving, at least every other day, of a good source of vitamin A. If
 the food chosen for vitamin C is also a good source of vitamin A, the
 additional serving of a vitamin A food may be omitted.

The remaining 1 to 3 or more servings may be of any vegetable or fruit,
including those that are valuable for vitamin C and for vitamin A.

Count as 1 serving: ½ cup of vegetable or fruit; or a portion as
ordinarily served, such as 1 medium apple, banana, orange, or potato,
half a medium grapefruit or cantaloup, or the juice of 1 lemon.


MILK GROUP


_Foods Included_

Milk—fluid whole, evaporated, skim, dry, buttermilk.

Cheese—cottage; cream; Cheddar-type, natural or process.

Ice cream.

[Illustration: Dairy products]


_Amounts Recommended_

Some milk every day for everyone.

Recommended amounts are given below in terms of 8-ounce cups of whole
fluid milk:

  Children under 9     2 to 3
  Children 9 to 12     3 or more
  Teen-agers           4 or more
  Adults               2 or more
  Pregnant women       3 or more
  Nursing mothers      4 or more

Part or all of the milk may be fluid skim milk, buttermilk, evaporated
milk, or dry milk.

Cheese and ice cream may replace part of the milk. The amount of either
it will take to replace a given amount of milk is figured on the basis
of calcium content. Common portions of cheese and of ice cream and
their milk equivalents in calcium are:

  1-inch cube Cheddar-type cheese = ½ cup milk
  ½ cup cottage cheese            = ⅓ cup milk
  2 tablespoons cream cheese      = 1 tablespoon milk
  ½ cup ice cream                 = ¼ cup milk


BREAD-CEREAL GROUP


_Foods Included_

All breads and cereals that are whole grain, enriched, or restored;
_check labels to be sure_.

Specifically, this group includes: Breads; cooked cereals; ready-to-eat
cereals; cornmeal; crackers; flour; grits; macaroni and spaghetti;
noodles; rice; rolled oats; and quick breads and other baked goods if
made with whole-grain or enriched flour. Bulgur and parboiled rice and
wheat also may be included in this group.

[Illustration: Bread products]


_Amounts Recommended_

Choose 4 servings or more daily. Or, if no cereals are chosen, have
an extra serving of breads or baked goods, which will make at least 5
servings from this group daily.

Count as 1 serving: 1 slice of bread; 1 ounce ready-to-eat cereal; ½
to ¾ cup cooked cereal, cornmeal, grits, macaroni, noodles, rice, or
spaghetti.


OTHER FOODS

To round out meals and meet energy needs, almost everyone will use
some foods not specified in the four food groups. Such foods include:
unenriched, refined breads, cereals, flours; sugars; butter, margarine,
other fats. These often are ingredients in a recipe or added to other
foods during preparation or at the table.

Try to include some vegetable oil among the fats used.


Maintaining desirable weight

It is best to maintain desirable weight for one’s height at all ages,
even during childhood. Here are two principles that you can use—

• Reduce food intake as you become less active. Exercise and activity
use up energy—or calories. If you cut down activity but not food, you
are providing more energy than the body needs. The excess is stored as
fat.

• Reduce food intake as you—as an adult—get older. As adults grow
older, less energy is needed to keep the body functioning.

To reduce food intake without shortchanging the body of essential
nutrients, follow the pattern of choices suggested by the Daily Food
Guide. Weight watchers need the same types of food for health as
everyone else. Crash diets and food fads are not the answer and may be
dangerous to health.

Cut down on food, but don’t cut out any important kinds of foods.

Snacks are counted as a part of the day’s total food. Sensible snacking
can help meet nutritional needs, but indiscriminate eating between
meals usually leads to more calories than are wanted, less of some
nutrients than are needed.

Specific information on controlling weight is given in Home and Garden
Bulletin 74, “Food and Your Weight.” It includes basic weight-control
facts, suggestions for reducing or gaining weight, meals and menus, and
calorie values of common foods.


Tips on meal planning

Keep these points in mind when you plan meals for your family:

• Include a variety of foods each day and from day to day. Introduce a
new food from time to time.

• Vary flavors and textures. Contrast strong flavor with mild, sweet
with sour. Combine crisp textures with smooth.

• Try to have some meat, poultry, fish, eggs, milk or cheese at each
meal.

• Make a collection of nutritious recipes that the family enjoys and
serve them often.

• Brighten food with color—a slice of red tomato, a sprig of dark
greens, or other garnish.

• Combine different sizes and shapes of food in a meal, when possible.




Servings and Pounds


If you are a thrifty food shopper, you learn to buy the kinds and
amounts of food that your family will use—with a minimum of waste. To
avoid waste and to make the most of your food dollar, you also need to
know how many servings you get from a market unit, such as 1 pound of
fresh carrots or a 10-ounce package of frozen peaches.

Information in this section can help you decide how much to buy to feed
your family.

The amount of meat, poultry, and fish to buy varies with the amount of
bone, fat, and breading.

Smart Buying


Meat

Your best guides for selecting meat are the U.S. Department of
Agriculture grades. Federally graded meats carry a purple grade stamp—a
shield enclosing the letters “USDA” and the grade name. These stamps
divide the wide range of meat quality into several groups.

Grade stamps appear on most retail beef, veal, calf, lamb, and mutton
cuts. Pork is not usually graded. Some meat packers, wholesalers, and
retailers use their own brand names to designate the quality levels of
their products.

USDA Prime, the top grade, is used largely by hotels and restaurants.
USDA Choice and USDA Good are the grades most commonly found in retail
markets. USDA Standard and Commercial grades are not often sold at
retail.

USDA meat inspection marks.]

Another purple stamp that may appear on fresh retail meat cuts is the
circular mark of Federal meat inspection (below, left). This shows
that meat is inspected and passed for wholesomeness, and that it is
processed under strict sanitary conditions. A round mark of Federal
meat inspection (below, right) also appears on processed meat products
to show they are made from wholesome meat, are processed under sanitary
conditions, and are truthfully labeled. All fresh or processed meat
products that are shipped from one State to another must bear a mark of
Federal inspection.

Not all meat is federally inspected. Some States and cities have their
own regulations for locally produced meats. However, the Wholesome Meat
Act of 1967 will ultimately assure consumers that all meat is inspected
by either the Federal Government or an adequate State system.


_Meat and your money_

At the meat counter, consider the amount of cooked lean meat you will
get for the money you pay.

The prices for a pound of beef chuck roast, pork rib roast, ground
beef, and beef liver may be about the same at your store. In many
instances, a pound of these roasts will provide only about half as much
cooked lean meat as a pound of ground beef or beef liver. The other
half of the pound of roast is bone, excess fat, and drippings.

So it would take twice as many pounds—and twice as much money—to feed
your family the roasts as it would the ground beef or liver, even
though the price per pound is the same.


Poultry

In retail markets, ready-to-cook poultry is available chilled or
frozen, whole or cut up. Processed poultry products are also on the
market in canned, frozen, dehydrated, and other convenient forms.

[Illustration: USDA poultry inspection and grademarks.]

Look for both the round U.S. Department of Agriculture inspection mark
and the shield-shaped grademark on the poultry you buy.

The round USDA inspection mark (above, left) means that poultry and
poultry products have been officially inspected for wholesomeness,
are truthfully labeled, and are not adulterated. USDA inspection is
required in plants that produce poultry products for sale across State
lines or in foreign trade.

The shield-shaped grademark (above, right) shows that the poultry has
been officially graded for quality. Poultry must be USDA-inspected
before it can be federally graded. The U.S. grades for poultry are
based on meatiness, freedom from defects, and general appearance. The
best grade of poultry is marked “USDA Grade A.”

Chicken, turkey, duck, and goose are common forms of poultry. Guinea
is available in some markets. The label may suggest suitable cooking
methods and indicate the age of the poultry—for chicken: “broiler or
fryer,” “roaster,” “stewing chicken;” for turkey: “fryer-roaster,”
“young hen,” “young tom,” “mature turkey.”


_Types of poultry_

Broilers, fryers, roasters, capons, and Rock Cornish game hens are
young chickens with tender meat. Stewing chickens, hens, and fowl are
mature chickens with less tender meat. Turkeys labeled fryer-roaster or
young turkey are young birds with tender meat. Most ducks are marketed
young as ducklings—broilers, fryers, and roasters. Most geese and
guineas are marketed as young geese and young guineas.

Ready-to-cook chickens are sold chilled or frozen—whole or cut into
parts. Most ready-to-cook turkeys are marketed frozen whole, in
a wide range of sizes; some are available chilled. Frozen turkey
halves, quarters, or parts are sometimes available. Ducks, geese, and
guineas—like turkeys—are generally marketed frozen whole. Ducklings are
also available as cut-up parts.

Frozen poultry, stuffed and ready for the oven, is available in many
markets. Boneless poultry roasts and rolls—so convenient—are also on
the market.


Fish

Today there are about 240 commercial species of fish and shellfish
marketed in the United States. They may be fresh, frozen, or canned.

Fresh fish are generally available by the pound in these forms—whole,
dressed, and in steaks, fillets, and chunks. Most fish dealers will
clean, dress, or fillet your fish for you. They can also tell you what
fish are in season and what fish are a good buy.

Frozen fish are usually packed during the season when they are
plentiful and are held in freezer storage until distributed. This means
that you can buy most fish throughout the year. Frozen fish come whole,
dressed, and in steaks, fillets, chunks, portions, and sticks.

Canned fish and specialty items containing fish are ready to serve or
use as bought. Canned tuna, salmon, mackerel, and Maine sardines are
widely available.


_Market forms_

Familiarize yourself with these market forms of fish:

 _Whole._—Fish marketed just as they come from the water. Ask your
 dealer to scale, eviscerate, and remove head, tail, and fins.

 _Dressed or pan-dressed._—Fish with scales and entrails removed,
 and—usually—head, tail, and fins removed. Small fish are called
 pan-dressed and are ready to cook as purchased. Large dressed fish may
 be cooked as purchased, but often are filleted or cut into steaks or
 chunks.

 _Steaks._—Cross-section slices from large dressed fish cut ⅝ to 1 inch
 thick. Steaks can be cooked as purchased.

 _Fillets._—Sides of the fish cut lengthwise away from the backbone.
 They may be skinned or the skin may be left on. Fillets are ready to
 cook as purchased.

 _Chunks._—Cross sections of large dressed fish. A cross section of
 the backbone is the only bone in a chunk. They are ready to cook as
 purchased.

 _Raw breaded fish portions._—Portions cut from frozen fish blocks,
 coated with a batter, breaded, packaged, and frozen. Raw breaded
 fish portions weigh more than 1½ ounces. They are ready to cook as
 purchased.

 _Fried fish portions._—Portions cut from frozen fish blocks, coated
 with a batter, breaded, partially cooked, packaged, and frozen. Fried
 fish portions weigh more than 1½ ounces. They are ready to heat and
 serve as purchased.

 _Fried fish sticks._—Sticks cut from frozen fish blocks, coated with
 a batter, breaded, partially cooked, packaged, and frozen. Fried fish
 sticks weigh up to 1½ ounces. They are ready to heat and serve as
 purchased.


_Inspection and grading_

The U.S. Department of the Interior provides an official inspection
service that enables you to identify high-quality seafoods. Such
products may be identified by the official USDI grade or inspection
shields that appear on the label. Fishery products that display these
shields have been processed under continuous in-plant inspection and
have met definite quality, processing, and packaging requirements.


Eggs

Buy graded eggs in cartons at a store that keeps them in refrigerated
cases. Federally graded eggs are identified with a shield-shaped
grademark that indicates the quality at the time of grading. If they
have been properly handled since grading, there should be little loss
in quality.

_Quality._—U.S. Grade AA (or Fresh Fancy) and Grade A eggs are
excellent for all purposes, but are especially good for poaching and
frying where the appearance of the finished product is important. Grade
B eggs are satisfactory for use in cooked dishes.

The grade of the egg does not affect its food value; lower grades are
as high in nutrients as top grades. Buy either white or brown eggs. The
color of the shell does not affect the nutritive value or quality of
the egg.

_Size._—Eggs are also classified by size according to weight per dozen.
Size is independent of quality; large eggs may be of high or low
quality and high-quality eggs may be of any size. Common market sizes
of eggs and the minimum weight per dozen:

  U.S. Extra Large—27 ounces.
  U.S. Large—24 ounces.
  U.S. Medium—21 ounces.
  U.S. Small—18 ounces.

The substitution of one size egg for another often makes little
difference in recipe results. However, in some recipes—for example in
sponge and angelfood cakes—the proportion of egg to other ingredients
is very important. For these recipes, it may be necessary to increase
the number of eggs if you are using a smaller size.


Fresh fruits and vegetables

Fresh fruits and vegetables are usually best in quality and lowest in
cost when in season.

Whatever fruit or vegetable you are buying, look first for freshness.
Pointers on selecting some fruits and vegetables follow on page 12.


_Fruits_

_Apples._—Good color usually indicates full flavor.

_Bananas._—Bananas should be firm, fresh in appearance, and unscarred.
Yellow or brown-flecked ones are ready for immediate use. Select
slightly green-colored bananas for use within a few days.

_Berries._—Select plump, solid berries with good color. Avoid wet or
leaky berries. Blackberries and raspberries with clinging caps may be
underripe. Strawberries without caps may be too ripe.

_Grapes._—Grapes should be plump, fresh in appearance, and firmly
attached to the stems. Red or black varieties should be well colored
for the variety. Most white or green varieties should have a slightly
amber tone.

_Melons (except watermelons)._—Ripe cantaloups have a yellowish surface
color; honeydews, a creamy color; crenshaws, a golden-yellow color
mottled with green; casabas, a yellow color; and persian melons, a dull
gray-green color. Ripe melons of these types usually have a fruity
aroma and a slight softening at the blossom end. A ripe cantaloup has
no stem; other melons may have stems attached.

_Oranges, grapefruit, and lemons._—Choose those heavy for their size.
Smooth, thin skins usually indicate more juice. Most skin markings do
not affect quality. Oranges with a slight greenish tinge may be just as
ripe as fully colored ones. Light or greenish-yellow lemons are more
tart than deep-yellow ones.

_Peaches._—Best quality peaches are fairly firm, not bruised, with
yellow or red color over the entire surface.

_Pears._—Some pears, especially winter varieties, are marketed when
slightly underripe and need to be ripened at home—at room temperature.
Pears are ripe and ready to eat when they yield slightly to moderate
pressure.

_Pineapples._—Pineapple varieties vary greatly in color. Ripe
pineapples have a fragrant, fruity aroma. Usually, the heavier the
fruit for its size, the better the quality. Avoid pineapples that have
decayed or moldy spots.

_Watermelons._—Ripe watermelons have a somewhat dull surface and a
creamy color underneath. The interior should be fully red and firm, and
should have few immature seeds.


_Vegetables_

_Asparagus._—Stalks should be tender and firm; tips should be close and
compact. Choose the stalks with little white—they are more tender. Use
asparagus promptly—it toughens rapidly.

_Beans, snap._—Choose slender beans with no large bumps (bumps indicate
large seeds). Avoid beans with dry-looking pods.

_Broccoli._—Look for small flower buds on compactly arranged heads with
good green color. Avoid yellowing, soft, or spreading heads.

_Brussels sprouts._—The heads should be firm with good green color.
Yellowing outer leaves and softness indicate aging. Smudgy, dirty spots
may indicate insect damage or decay.

_Cabbage._—Choose heads that are firm and heavy. Outer leaves should be
fresh, green, and free from worm-holes.

_Cauliflower._—Choose heads that are compact, firm, and white or creamy
white. Avoid discolored heads and those with soft spots.

_Celery._—Best-quality celery is fresh and crisp. It is clean and
has leaves that appear fresh; stems do not have black or brown
discoloration. Avoid pithy, woody, or very stringy celery.

_Corn._—Good-quality fresh corn has husks that are fresh and green. The
ears are well filled with plump, firm, milky kernels. Immature ears of
corn have small, undeveloped, watery kernels. Overmature ears have very
firm, large, starchy kernels, often indented.

_Cucumbers._—Choose firm, slender cucumbers for best quality. Avoid
yellowed cucumbers and those with withered or shrivelled ends.

_Lettuce (head)._—Select heads that are green, fresh, crisp, and fairly
firm to firm. Head lettuce should be free from rusty appearance and
excessive outer leaves.

_Onions (dry)._—Size and color do not affect flavor or quality of
dry onions. Clean, hard, well-shaped onions with dry skins are
usually of good quality. Moisture at the neck may be a sign of decay.
Mild-flavored onions, which are often large, may be elongated or flat.
Stronger-flavored onions are usually medium size and globe shaped.

_Peas and lima beans._—Select pods that are well filled but not
bulging. Avoid dried, spotted, yellowed, or flabby pods.

_Potatoes._—Best-quality potatoes are firm, smooth, and well shaped.
They are free from cuts, blemishes, and decay. To judge quality more
easily, look for potatoes that are reasonably clean. Avoid potatoes
with wasteful deep eyes. Potatoes with green skins may be bitter. If
you plan to buy a large quantity of potatoes, buy a few first to see if
they are the kind you want. Early-crop potatoes, harvested in spring
and summer, tend to be less mealy when cooked than those harvested
later.

_Root vegetables._—Choose smooth, firm vegetables. Very large carrots
may have woody cores; oversized radishes may be pithy; oversized
turnips, beets, and parsnips may be woody. The size and condition of
the tops on root vegetables do not necessarily indicate the eating
quality.

_Sweetpotatoes._—Choose sweetpotatoes that are clean, smooth, well
shaped, and firm. Damp or soft spots may indicate decay. There are two
types of sweetpotatoes. The moist type has soft, moist, orange-colored
flesh and bronze or rosy skin. The dry type has firm, dry, somewhat
mealy, yellow-colored flesh and yellow or light-brown skin.

_Tomatoes._—Choose tomatoes that are plump, firm, and uniformly pink,
red, or yellow in color. They should be free from growth cracks, scars,
and bruises. The best flavored tomatoes are ripened on the vine.

For more information, see Home and Garden Bulletins 141, “How to Buy
Fresh Fruits,” and 143, “How to Buy Fresh Vegetables.”


Canned and frozen foods

_Canned._—You may want to choose the highest quality for salads, or for
serving “as is.” But second quality may do for combination dishes such
as stews, casserole dishes, soups, and fruit puddings, where uniform
size, shape, or color is not important.

_Frozen._—Buy only packages that are frozen solid. Avoid partially
thawed packages that feel soft or are stained. Thawing and refreezing
lower quality.




Wise Storing


Meat, poultry, and fish

All meat should be promptly refrigerated.

The transparent wrap on prepackaged meat, poultry, or fish is designed
for refrigerator storage at home for 1 or 2 days.

Meat or poultry wrapped in meat paper when brought from the store—or
prepackaged roasts and steaks that may be stored in the refrigerator
for 3 to 5 days—should be unwrapped, placed on a platter or tray, and
loosely covered before refrigerating. Wrap and store fish separately
from other foods. Poultry giblets should also be wrapped and stored
separately.

Keep cooked meat, poultry, and fish, and the gravy or broth made from
them, in covered containers in the refrigerator. Use within 1 or 2 days.

_Cured and smoked meats._—ham, frankfurters, bacon, sausage—can be
stored in their original containers in the refrigerator. Mild-cured
hams are similar to fresh meats in keeping quality. Use whole hams
within a week, half hams and slices within 3 to 5 days. For best
flavor, use bacon, franks, and smoked sausages within a week.


Eggs

To help maintain quality, store eggs in the refrigerator promptly after
purchase—large end up.

For best flavor and cooking quality, use eggs within 1 week if
possible. Eggs held in the refrigerator for a long time may develop
off-flavors and lose some thickening and leavening power.

Cover leftover yolks with cold water and refrigerate in a tightly
covered container. Refrigerate leftover egg whites, too, in a tightly
covered container. Use leftover yolks or whites within 1 or 2 days.


Fresh fruits and vegetables

Fresh fruits should be ripe when stored in the refrigerator.
Some unripe fruits will ripen if left for a time at room
temperature—preferably in a cool room between 60° and 70° F.

Keep bananas at room temperature. They will turn dull brown if
refrigerated. Sort berries and cherries; then refrigerate, unwashed.
Use promptly. Refrigerate ripe pineapples.

Sweet corn keeps best if refrigerated uncovered in husks; use it
promptly. Removing tops from carrots, beets, and radishes reduces
wilting. Storing potatoes in a cool, dark place prevents greening.

shortenings (those that have been hydrogenated), covered, at room
temperature. Refrigerate opened jars of salad dressing; do not freeze.


Canned, frozen, and dried foods

_Canned foods._—Store in a dry place at room temperature (not above 70°
F.).

_Frozen foods._—Can be stored in freezing unit of refrigerator up to 1
week. For longer storage, keep in a freezer at 0° F.

_Dried foods._—Store _dried fruits_ in tightly closed containers
at room temperature (not above 70° F.). In warm, humid weather,
refrigerate.

Store _nonfat dry milk_ in a closed container at a temperature of
75° F., or lower. Because of its higher milkfat content, _dry whole
milk_ does not keep as well as nonfat dry milk. Keep dry whole milk
in a tightly closed container in the refrigerator. Refrigerate
_reconstituted dry milk_ as you would fresh fluid milk.

this bulletin are not intended for use with either instantized or
self-rising flour.

“Baking powder” refers to _double-acting baking powder_ that leavens
during mixing and again during baking. Quick-acting baking powder
(containing cream of tartar) is single-acting; it can be used most
satisfactorily in foods that are mixed and baked immediately. (See One
Ingredient For Another, p. 17, for amounts.)

“Fat or oil” refers to any type—butter, margarine, shortening, lard, or
any kind of vegetable oil. In recipes specifying a particular type of
fat—“butter or margarine,” for example—you’ll have best results with
the fat suggested. Recipes in this bulletin are not intended for use
with whipped fats.


Measuring foods

All measurements given in this bulletin are level.

Frequently used food measurements are given below.

  1 tablespoon = 3 teaspoons
  1 fluid ounce = 2 tablespoons
  ¼ cup = 4 tablespoons
  ⅓ cup = 5⅓ tablespoons
  ½ cup = 8 tablespoons
  ⅔ cup = 10⅔ tablespoons
  ¾ cup = 12 tablespoons
  1 cup = 16 tablespoons or 8 fluid ounces
  1 pint = 2 cups
  1 quart = 2 pints or 4 cups

_Part of cup._—Use tablespoons or small measures-½, ⅓, ¼ cup—for
greater accuracy.

_Brown sugar._—Pack firmly into cup or spoon and level off top with
straight, thin edge of spatula or knife.

_Solid fats._—Pack fat firmly into cup or smaller measure and level off
top with straight, thin edge of spatula or knife.

To measure less than 1 cup, you can also use the water method: Partly
fill a cup with cold water, leaving enough space for the amount of fat
needed. (To measure ¼ cup of fat, for example, fill cup with water to ¾
mark.) Spoon fat into cup, push under water until water level reaches
1-cup mark. Drain thoroughly before using fat.

For solid fat in sticks or pounds, cut off amount needed. A 1-pound
form measures about 2 cups; a ¼-pound stick of butter or margarine
measures ½ cup.

_Flour._—Spoon flour lightly into measuring cup until measure is
overflowing. Do not shake or tap cup. Level off top with straight, thin
edge of spatula or knife.

_Fine meal, fine crumbs._—Stir lightly with fork or spoon. Measure like
flour.

_Baking powder, cornstarch, cream of tartar, spices._—Dip spoon into
container and bring it up heaping full. Level off top with straight,
thin edge of spatula or knife.

_Dry milk._—Pour dry milk from spout or opening in package, or spoon
lightly, into measuring cup until measure is overflowing. Do not shake.
Level off top with straight, thin edge of spatula or knife.

Main Dishes


Foods that abound in protein—meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and cheese—make
satisfying main dishes. Thrifty main dishes often combine these
protein-rich foods with vegetables and cereals—beef stew with
vegetables or dumplings, chicken with rice, fish with stuffing, cheese
with macaroni.

Dry beans and peas are also economical choices for main dishes.

If the main dish is not high in protein, you can supply additional
protein with other foods in the meal. If, for example, a pound of
meat is to serve eight persons, you might combine it with vegetables
or cereal in a casserole or stew, have milk to drink, and serve
cheese-topped apple pie for dessert.


Meat

Meat cooked at low to moderate temperatures is more tender, juicy, and
flavorful than meat cooked at high temperatures. There is more meat to
serve because there is less shrinkage at low temperatures.

Beef may be cooked rare, medium, or well done. Lamb is enjoyed either
medium or well done, but veal and pork are usually cooked well done.

Broiling, pan-frying, and roasting are recommended for tender meats
only. Less tender cuts are more satisfactory if braised, pot-roasted,
or simmered. For suggested methods for cooking, see guide on [page 19].

Frozen meat need not be thawed before cooking, but extra cooking time
will be required if it is not thawed first.


_Roasting ... beef, veal, lamb, pork_

Place roast, fat side up, on a rack in a shallow pan. Do not add water;
do not cover. Season either before or after cooking.

Check the timetable (p. 20) for approximate roasting times. The quality
of the meat, its size and shape, and its temperature at the start of
cooking will affect the roasting time. Times given here are for meats
at refrigerator temperature. Frozen roasts may take 1½ to 2 times as
long to cook as unfrozen roasts of the same weight and shape.

If you are using a meat thermometer, insert it so the tip is at the
center of the thickest part of the roast, and not touching bone or fat.


_Broiling ... beef, lamb, cured ham_

Slash fat around edge of meat to prevent curling. Place meat on cold
broiler grid.

Broiling temperature can be regulated by the distance meat is placed
from heat source and whether the door is open or closed during
broiling. Because broilers vary widely, follow the manufacturer’s
directions. If you like meat well done, place it farther from the heat
source than for medium or rare meat—to avoid burning the outside before
the center is cooked. Place thicker cuts farther from the heat source
than thin ones, for the same reason.

  [8] Can also be served without heating, if desired.

Broil until top side of meat is browned, about half of total cooking
time. Season, turn, and brown other side. Use timetable (next page) as
a guide to total broiling time. To tell if meat is done, cut into it
along bone and observe color.

Use a low temperature for broiling frozen meat, so the surface does not
char before the interior thaws and cooks. Allow 1½ to 2 times as long
as specified in the timetable on page 21.


_Pan broiling ... beef, lamb, pork_

Choose thin steaks, chops, or ham slices (1 inch thick or less). Or
shape meat patties less than an inch thick.

Slash fat around edge of meat to prevent it from curling. Grease pan
lightly with fat or rub pan with fat edge of meat.

Cook meat slowly over moderate heat, turning occasionally as necessary.
Pour off excess fat as it accumulates. Total cooking time will be 10 to
20 minutes, depending on the degree of doneness desired. Pork chops may
take a little longer.

Remove meat from pan, season, and serve.


_Braising ... beef, veal, lamb, pork_

Brown meat slowly on all sides in enough added fat to keep meat from
sticking. Use a heavy pan. Meats may be floured or not, as desired,
before browning. Floured meats brown better than unfloured meats. Meats
that have a considerable amount of fat and that are not floured can be
browned without added fat.

Season the meat. If necessary to prevent overbrowning, add a small
amount of liquid (about ½ cup for a roast). Many cuts of meat can be
braised without added liquid. Steam from meat juices trapped in a
covered pan provides enough moisture. Cover pan tightly.

Cook slowly over low heat or in a 350° F. oven until tender, adding
more liquid if needed. Use the timetable (p. 22) as a guide to braising
time.

Poultry

Serve poultry often—it’s versatile, flavorful, and economical. You can
buy chicken and turkey in convenient sizes—chilled or frozen—any day of
the year. And for variety, try duck and goose.


_Preparing poultry_

_Ready-to-cook poultry_ needs little preparation before cooking.
Inspect for pinfeathers. Wash and drain poultry.

Keep _frozen poultry_ frozen until time to thaw or cook. Frozen poultry
usually is thawed before cooking, but poultry parts or whole poultry
frozen without giblets can be cooked without thawing. Cooking time will
be longer than for unfrozen poultry. Do not thaw commercially frozen
stuffed poultry before cooking.

To thaw poultry in the refrigerator, place frozen poultry on a tray or
shallow pan to catch the thawing drip; if unwrapped, cover lightly.
Remove giblets from cavity when bird is pliable.

If it is not practical to thaw poultry in the refrigerator, immerse
poultry in a watertight wrapper in cold water. Change water often to
hasten thawing. Or you can partially thaw poultry in the refrigerator
and partially in cold water. It takes 1 to 8 hours to thaw poultry in
cold water, or 1 to 3 days in a refrigerator.

Cook poultry promptly after thawing. Stuff poultry just before
roasting.


_Cooking guides_

Most poultry sold whole can be roasted. Stewing chickens and mature
turkeys, however, are more tender if braised or stewed. They are good
for stews, or to provide cooked meat for casseroles, sandwiches, and
salads.

Broiler or fryer chickens can be roasted, ovenbaked, barbecued, or
cooked on a rotisserie as well as broiled or fried. Fryer-roaster
turkeys weighing 4 or 5 pounds can be roasted whole, or can be cut into
parts and fried or broiled.

Rock Cornish game hens can be cooked like broiler or fryer chickens.
Small ducks are suitable for broiling or frying; larger ones, for
roasting or rotisserie cooking. Geese roast very well.

Roast poultry uncovered for best color and to reduce splitting and
shrinkage. Poultry can be roasted with or without stuffing; unstuffed
birds take slightly less time to cook. Cook poultry until tender and
juicy; do not overcook.


_Roasting_

Prepare the poultry as directed above. Stuff the body and neck cavities
lightly; allow about ½ cup of stuffing per pound of ready-to-cook
poultry. See stuffing recipe (p. 28). Or if desired, leave poultry
unstuffed.

Fold loose neck skin toward back; fasten with a skewer. Turn wingtips
back of heavy wingbone to rest against neck skin. Tuck ends of legs
under band of skin at tail or fasten legs together close to body.

To roast poultry, place breast side up on a rack in a shallow pan. Do
not cover pan and do not add water.

See roasting guide (p. 28) for approximate times for roasting poultry.

A meat thermometer is the best guide to doneness of turkeys. Insert the
thermometer into the center of the inner thigh muscle. Make sure it
does not touch the bone.

Salt the giblets and neck, seal them in aluminum foil, and roast along
with the poultry. Or simmer them in salted water until tender.

You can baste poultry with pan drippings or a little fat if you like.

If poultry browns early in the roasting period, cover the breast and
drumsticks lightly with aluminum foil or with a thin cloth moistened
with fat. After poultry is partly roasted, cut band of skin that holds
legs together.

Use any one or more of the following ways to tell if poultry is done:

 • A meat thermometer inserted in the center of the inner thigh muscle
 of a turkey reaches 180° to 185° F. If turkey is stuffed, also check
 stuffing temperature by inserting a thermometer into the body cavity
 for 5 minutes. Temperature should reach 165° F.

 • Drumstick feels soft when you press meaty part with protected
 fingers.

 • Drumstick moves up and down easily and leg joint gives readily.

CAUTION: Do not partly roast poultry on one day and complete roasting
the following day.

  [11] Unstuffed poultry may take slightly less time than stuffed
  poultry. Cooking time is based on chilled poultry or poultry that
  has just been thawed—temperature not above 40° F. Frozen unstuffed
  poultry will take longer. Do not use this roasting guide for frozen
  commercially stuffed poultry; follow package directions.


Stuffing

Place boneless turkey roast on a rack in a pan; insert a meat
thermometer in the center of the roast; cover pan tightly. Braise in
an oven at 400° F. (hot) until thermometer registers about 170° F. Or,
follow cooking directions on package.

NOTE: A 3-pound boneless turkey roast requires about 1½ hours cooking
time. If desired, uncover roast last 20 minutes to brown.


Broiled chicken

  Plump young chicken, about 1½ to 2¼ pounds ready to cook
  Melted fat or oil
  Salt and pepper, as desired

Leave whole or cut in serving-size pieces.

Place the chicken in a deep pan. Add enough water to half cover a whole
chicken or to cover pieces. Season as desired.

Cover pan and cook over low heat until the chicken is tender—2 to 3
hours for a stewing chicken, 45 minutes to 1 hour for a broiler-fryer.

Cook giblets with the chicken or separately.

Serve stewed chicken in gravy made by thickening the broth, or use in
any recipe that calls for cooked chicken.


Fried chicken

  Plump young chicken, 1½ to 3 pounds ready to cook

fish. Fill fry kettle one-third full of fat; heat to 350° F.

Place fish in a single layer in a fry basket. Fry 3 to 5 minutes, or
until fish are brown and flake easily when tested with a fork. Drain on
absorbent paper.

Eggs, cheese, dry beans

Main dishes made with eggs, cheese, or dry beans are economical choices
for family meals.


_Cooking eggs_

For best eating quality, eggs should be cooked with low to moderate
heat, for just the right amount of time. If cooking temperature is too
high or the egg is cooked too long, the white becomes tough and the
yolk mealy.


Caution on Use of Cracked or Soiled Eggs

Cracked or soiled eggs may contain bacteria that can produce food
poisoning. For your protection, use cracked or soiled eggs only when
they are thoroughly cooked or when the foods in which they are an
ingredient are thoroughly cooked.

In this publication, a warning note is given with each recipe in which
cracked or soiled eggs should not be used.


Scrambled eggs

Break eggs into a bowl. Add milk as follows: For creamy scrambled eggs,
add 1 tablespoon milk for each ego; for dry scrambled eggs, add ½
tablespoon milk for each egg. For a product with uniform yellow color,
beat mixture enough to blend yolks and whites thoroughly. If you prefer
scrambled eggs with flecks of yellow and white, beat only slightly.
Season with salt and pepper.

Pour the mixture into a heated frypan in which a little fat has been
melted. Cook slowly, stirring occasionally to let the uncooked portion
flow to the bottom. Cook until the mixture is set, but still moist.

Or, if preferred, use a double boiler. Melt a little fat in the top
part, pour in the egg mixture, place over simmering water in the bottom
of the boiler, and cook as above.

NOTE: _Use only clean, sound-shelled eggs in this recipe._


_Variation_

Before cooking the mixture, add herbs, chopped onion, shredded cheese,
or small pieces of cooked bacon or ham.


Eggs cooked in shell

Put eggs in a pan; cover them completely with cold water.

_For soft-cooked eggs_, heat water slowly to simmering. Cover pan and
remove from heat. Let stand 3 to 5 minutes; allow the longer time for a
larger number of eggs or for a firmer consistency.

NOTE: _Use only clean, sound-shelled eggs in this recipe._

_For hard-cooked eggs_, bring water to simmering and simmer 20 to 25
minutes. Do not let the water boil. Serve the eggs hot or plunge them
at once into cold running water and leave until cold.

NOTE: The green discoloration that sometimes appears between the white
and the yolk of a hard-cooked egg results from a chemical reaction,
which is harmless. To help prevent this discoloration, cook eggs at low
temperature, avoid overcooking, and cool promptly.


Fried eggs

Heat a small amount of fat in a frypan. Bacon or ham drippings may be
used for flavor. Break eggs, one at a time, into a saucer, and slip
them into the fat. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook over low heat,
basting with the fat, until whites are firm.

Or, if you prefer eggs with less fat, use this “fry-poach” method.
Melt a little fat in a frypan over low heat—just enough to grease the
bottom. Add eggs one at a time, pour in 2 or 3 tablespoons of water,
cover pan tightly, and steam until eggs are done. Season before serving.

NOTE: _Use only clean, sound-shelled eggs in this recipe._


French toast

_6 servings_

  4 eggs, beaten
  ⅔ cup milk
  ¼ teaspoon salt
  12 slices white bread
  2 tablespoons fat or oil

Combine eggs, milk, and salt. Dip each side of bread in egg mixture.

Brown on both sides in fat on a hot griddle—3 to 4 minutes on each
side. Serve immediately.

NOTE: _Use only clean, sound-shelled eggs in this recipe._


_Variation_

Add ½ teaspoon cinnamon or nutmeg to egg mixture before dipping bread.


Plain or french omelet

_6 servings_

  6 eggs
  ¾ teaspoon salt
  Pepper, as desired
  6 tablespoons milk
  3 tablespoons butter or margarine

Beat eggs until yolks and whites are well mixed.

Add salt, pepper, and milk.

Melt the fat in a large frypan and pour in the egg mixture.

Cook over moderate heat. As the omelet cooks, lift edges toward center
and tip pan so that the uncooked mixture flows under the cooked
portion. Continue cooking until bottom is light brown.

Fold one half of the omelet over the other half and serve at once.

NOTE: _Use only clean, sound-shelled eggs in this recipe._


_Variations_

Spread tart jelly or browned mushrooms on half the omelet just before
folding.

Sprinkle top of the omelet with shredded cheese, your favorite herbs,
or bits of crisp bacon or ham.


Poached eggs

Break eggs into a saucer or custard cup, one at a time, then slip them
into gently boiling, salted water—enough water to cover the eggs in a
shallow pan.

Reheat water to simmering, take pan from heat, cover. Let stand 5
minutes, or until eggs are of desired firmness. Remove eggs from water
and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

NOTE: _Use only clean, sound-shelled eggs in this recipe._


Poached eggs supreme

_6 servings_

  1 can (10½ ounces) condensed Cheddar cheese soup
  2 tablespoons chopped green pepper
  ¼ cup process sharp Cheddar cheese spread
  6 slices toast
  6 eggs

Combine soup and green pepper; heat. Spread cheese on toast. Poach
eggs until firm (p. 38). Place eggs on toast and cover with hot soup
mixture. Serve immediately.

NOTE: _Use only clean, sound-shelled eggs in this recipe._


_Menu suggestion_

Serve with green beans, fruit salad, and oatmeal cookies.


Deviled eggs

_6 servings_

  6 eggs
  ¼ cup mayonnaise
  1 teaspoon prepared mustard
  ½ teaspoon vinegar
  ¼ teaspoon salt
  White pepper, as desired
  Paprika

Hard-cook eggs as directed on page 37. Cool eggs under cold running
water 5 to 10 minutes. Peel shells from eggs. Cut eggs in half
lengthwise. Mash yolks with remaining ingredients except paprika until
mixture is smooth. Fill whites with this mixture; sprinkle with paprika.


_Variation_

_Ham-deviled eggs._—Omit salt. Add 1 can (2¼ ounces) deviled ham to
yolk mixture.


Baked eggs in hash nests

_6 servings_

  1 can (1 pound, 8 ounces) corned beef hash
  6 eggs
  2 tablespoons fine dry breadcrumbs, if desired
  Salt and pepper, as desired
  1 tablespoon butter or margarine

Spread hash evenly in a 10½- by 7- by 2-inch baking pan. Form six
depressions by pressing the bottom of a ½-cup measure into the hash.

Break an egg into each depression. Sprinkle each egg with breadcrumbs,
if desired. Sprinkle with salt and pepper; dot with fat.

Bake at 325° F. (slow oven) 20 to 25 minutes, or until eggs are as firm
as desired.

 NOTE: _Use only clean, sound-shelled eggs in this recipe._


_Menu suggestion_

Serve with mixed vegetables, lettuce wedges, and brownies.


Cooking cheese

Cheese, like eggs, should be cooked at low temperatures and never
overcooked.

Melt cheese over simmering water, or add it to a hot mixture. Add
cheese to a sauce after the sauce is cooked and heat only long enough
to melt the cheese. Add cheese to an omelet just before folding.

Bake casseroles containing cheese at low to moderate temperatures. To
keep cheese toppings from toughening or hardening, cover the cheese
with crumbs or add cheese just a few minutes before the casserole comes
out of the oven.

Cheese blends more readily with other ingredients and melts more
quickly if you shred or dice it first.


Spanish rice with cheese

_6 servings_

  3 slices bacon
  1 small onion, finely chopped
  ¼ cup chopped green pepper
  ¼ cup chopped celery
  1 cup water
  ½ teaspoon salt
  ¾ cup packaged precooked rice
  2 cups cooked or canned tomatoes
  1 teaspoon sugar
  ¼ teaspoon worcestershire sauce
  1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Fry bacon in a heavy 2-quart saucepan. Drain bacon on paper. In 1
tablespoon bacon drippings, lightly brown onion, green pepper, and
celery.

Add water and salt; bring to a boil. Stir in rice, tomatoes, sugar,
and worcestershire sauce. Simmer until rice is just tender, stirring
occasionally.

Crumble bacon and stir into rice mixture. Sprinkle cheese over top.
Cover and continue cooking over very low heat until cheese is melted,
about 5 minutes.


_Menu suggestion_

Serve with kale, fruit salad, and ice cream.


Pizza

_2 pizzas, 14 inches in diameter_

  1 yeast roll recipe (p. 59)
  4 cups shredded cheese (Mozzarella, Muenster, Colby, or process
      Swiss or Cheddar)
  2 cans (8 ounces each) Spanish-style tomato sauce
  ½ teaspoon oregano
  ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese

Preheat oven with oven regulator set at broil; leave oven door closed.

  12 slices white bread
  ¾ pound process Cheddar cheese, thinly sliced
  3 eggs, beaten
  3 cups milk
  ½ teaspoon salt
  ¼ teaspoon pepper
  Sage, as desired
  1 tablespoon butter or margarine

topping with bread.


_Menu suggestion_

Serve with peas, coleslaw, and apple pie.


_Cooking dry beans_

Dry beans need soaking before cooking. Use 2½ cups water for 1 cup of
blackeye beans (blackeye peas, cowpeas), Great Northern beans, and lima
beans. Use 3 cups water for 1 cup of kidney beans, pea (navy) beans,
and pinto beans.

To soak them quickly, boil beans 2 minutes, remove from heat, and let
stand 1 hour. Or if you prefer, boil beans 2 minutes and let them stand
overnight.

Cook the beans in the soaking water. Add 1 teaspoon salt for 1 cup of
beans; boil gently for the time given below. One cup of uncooked beans
yields about 2½ cups cooked beans.

                            _Approximate
                            cooking time
      Kind of beans            (hours)_

  Blackeye (blackeye peas,            ½
    cowpeas).
  Great Northern               1  to 1½
  Kidney                             2
  Lima                               1
  Pea (navy)                   1½ to 2
  Pinto                              2

Dry beans will cook more quickly if you add baking soda to the water
before soaking. If tap water is of medium hardness, adding ⅛ teaspoon
soda to the water for each cup of dry beans reduces cooking time about
one-fourth. Measure soda exactly; too much soda affects flavor and
nutritive value of beans.

To reduce foaming when cooking dry beans, add 1 tablespoon meat
drippings or other fat to the cooking water for each cup of beans.

Cooked dry beans may be seasoned and eaten without further cooking, or
they may be baked, or combined with other foods.

If acid ingredients like tomatoes, catsup, or vinegar are included
in the recipe, add them after the beans are tender. Acids prevent
softening of the beans.


Boston baked beans

_6 servings_

  2 cups dry navy beans

  2 teaspoons chopped onion
  ½ cup dark molasses

Boil beans in water 2 minutes. Soak 1 hour, or overnight if preferred.

Vegetables


Knowing how to prepare vegetables to retain their nutritive value and
appetite appeal is a test of any good cook. To help you improve your
skill with vegetables, here are some cooking tips—

• Boil vegetables in as little water as possible; losses in vitamins
and minerals will be less, the less water you use. Serve the cooking
liquids with your vegetables, or make them into sauces, gravies, or
soups.

• Cook vegetables until just tender, and serve them immediately; they
will taste better and retain more nutrients.

• Trim leafy vegetables like lettuce and cabbage sparingly. Use the
dark outer leaves—they are especially rich in nutrients. Remove woody
midribs from kale leaves—there is little nutritive loss and the kale
cooks more uniformly.


Fresh vegetables


_Preparing for cooking_

Wash vegetables thoroughly. Use plenty of water for leafy greens; wash
several times, lifting vegetables from the water.

Remove bruised, wilted, or tough parts; trim sparingly.

Soak fresh brussels sprouts and broccoli in cold salt water (2
teaspoons salt for each quart of water) 30 to 60 minutes to remove any
insects.


_Cooking times_

In using the Boiling Guide for Fresh Vegetables on the following
page, remember that vegetables may require shorter or longer cooking
time than given, the exact time depending on quality and variety of
vegetable. The altitude at which you live will also affect cooking
times; you can shorten the time by cutting, slicing, dicing, or
coarsely shredding vegetables.


_Boiling fresh vegetables_

Bring salted water to a boil. One-half to 1 cup water usually is enough
for 6 servings of young, tender vegetables. Older root vegetables that
need longer cooking may require water to cover. Spinach and other
greens need only the water clinging to their leaves from washing if
cooked over low heat in a pan with a tight-fitting lid. Tomatoes can be
cooked in their own juice.

Add vegetable. Cover, and quickly bring water back to a boil. Reduce
heat and cook gently until vegetable is just tender. Start timing after
water returns to boiling.


Frozen and canned vegetables

_Frozen._—Cook frozen vegetables according to package directions.
For uniform cooking, thaw leafy vegetables just enough to separate
the leaves before you put them in boiling water. Partly thaw corn on
the cob before cooking it. If necessary, separate pieces of frozen
vegetables with a fork during cooking.

_Canned._—Commercially canned vegetables need reheating only. If liquid
is not served with the vegetable, save it for other uses. (See Ways to
Use Leftovers, p. 75.)

Unless you are absolutely sure home-canned vegetables have been
processed correctly, bring them to a rolling boil. Then cover and boil
for at least 10 minutes. Boil spinach and corn 20 minutes. If food
looks spoiled, foams, or has an off-odor during heating, destroy it.


Serving boiled vegetables

_Hot, seasoned._—Any vegetable or a combination of two or more.

Before cooking, add a pinch of an herb, such as marjoram or thyme. Or
after cooking, season with butter, margarine, or drippings—or with
salad oil and lemon juice, horseradish, or garlic. Or sprinkle cooked
vegetables with herb vinegar or crumbled bacon.

_Mashed._—Potatoes, sweetpotatoes, turnips, rutabagas, kohlrabi,
carrots, winter squash.

Drain and mash cooked vegetable. Add hot milk or cream to moisten if
needed. Season with salt, pepper, and butter or margarine. Beat until
fluffy.

_Creamed._—Peas, carrots, celery, cabbage, asparagus, broccoli,
potatoes, snap beans, onions, lima beans, cauliflower, spinach.

For 6 servings, combine 3 cups drained cooked vegetable with 1½ cups
medium white sauce (p. 57); heat. You may prefer thin white sauce with
potatoes or lima beans.

For quick creamed vegetables, pour 1 can (10½ ounces) undiluted
condensed soup—Cheddar cheese or cream of celery or mushroom—over 3
cups drained cooked vegetable; heat.

Salads and Salad Dressings


What better way to serve a variety of fruits, vegetables, even
meats—than in a colorful salad? As an appetizer, a side dish, a
dessert, or the main course of your meal, a salad brings lots of
goodness to your table. Salads can be light or hearty, depending on the
ingredients you choose.

Summertime salads often feature a medley of fresh fruits. Tossed green
salads are year-round favorites. Salads made from eggs and potatoes,
from seafoods, and from meats and cheeses also deserve a place in your
meal planning.


Tips on salad making

Selecting top-quality fruits and vegetables is a good start toward a
good salad. Fresh food has eye and taste appeal.

Give salad foods the best care to avoid damage and to keep them fresh.
If you prepare salad ingredients ahead of time, store them, without
dressing, in the refrigerator.

If you plan to use unpeeled fruits or vegetables in a salad, choose
those with smooth, tender, colorful skins.

See page 12 for other pointers on selecting fresh fruits and
vegetables. You’ll find suggestions for storing them on page 14.


_For appetite appeal_

Chill ingredients before you mix your salad.

For tossed green salads, tear greens into fairly large pieces. This
will give your salad more body.

Always thoroughly drain the greens you use in salads.

Vary your salad greens. Try chicory, escarole, endive, kale, spinach,
dandelion greens, romaine, watercress, and chinese cabbage.

Some salad fruits are likely to turn dark on standing; dip these in a
little citrus juice.

Drain canned fruits and vegetables before you add them to a salad.


Tips on dressings

Main-dish salads made with meat, fish, poultry, eggs, beans, cheese, or
potatoes usually call for a mayonnaise-type dressing, but some are good
with french or italian dressing (p. 53).

On vegetable salads and vegetable-fruit combinations, try french,
italian, thousand island, or Roquefort or blue cheese dressing (p.
53). Fruit salads taste best with sweet dressings—sweet french,
orange-honey, or celery seed dressing ([p. 53]).

Prevent sogginess and wilting by using just enough salad dressing to
moisten ingredients. Add dressing to raw vegetable salads at the last
minute unless your recipe calls for marinated vegetables.


Salad go-togethers

Some salad combinations are traditional—lettuce and sliced tomatoes,
canned peaches and cottage cheese. You can make a variety of salads by

them.

Yeast rolls

_18 to 24 rolls_

  1 package active dry yeast or 1 cake compressed yeast
  ¼ cup warm water (about 110° F.)
  ¾ cup hot milk
  ¼ cup shortening or oil
  ¼ cup sugar
  1¼ teaspoons salt
  1 egg
  About 4 cups flour

Dissolve yeast in water. Mix milk, fat, sugar, and salt in a large
mixing bowl. Cool to lukewarm.

Stir in egg and yeast. Add 2 cups flour and beat until smooth.
Gradually stir in more flour until dough leaves sides of bowl.

Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead until dough is
smooth and elastic.

Place in a lightly greased bowl and turn over once to grease upper side
of dough. Cover and let rise in a warm place (80° to 85° F.) until
almost double in bulk, 1 to 1¼ hours. Dough should rise until a light
touch leaves a slight depression. Press the dough down into the bowl to
remove air bubbles.

To make plain rolls, divide dough into small pieces and roll into balls
about 1½ inches in diameter. Place in a shallow greased pan with sides
touching—or 1 inch apart if you prefer crusty sides.

Cover loosely and let rise in a warm place until double in bulk, 45
minutes to 1 hour.

Bake at 400° F. (hot oven) 15 to 20 minutes.

Brush rolls with melted butter or margarine after removing them from
the oven.


_Variations_

_Crescent rolls._—Divide dough into three portions. On a lightly
floured surface, roll out each portion into a circle about 10 inches in
diameter. Brush with melted butter or margarine. Cut each circle into 6
wedges; roll wedges up tightly, beginning at wide end. Place on greased
baking sheet with points down; curve ends to form crescents. Let rise
and bake.

_Cinnamon-nut rolls._—Roll dough out on lightly floured surface into a
rectangle about ¼-inch thick. Brush with melted butter or margarine.
Sprinkle with a mixture of ½ cup sugar and 2 teaspoons cinnamon. Press
½ cup chopped nuts into dough. Roll as for jelly roll; seal edge. Cut
into ¾-inch slices. Place close together, cut side down, in a greased
shallow baking pan. Let rise and bake.

_Cloverleaf rolls._—Divide dough into very small pieces and roll into
balls about ¾ inch in diameter. Dip each ball in melted butter or
margarine and place three balls together in a greased muffin tin. Let
rise and bake.


Biscuits

_12 biscuits_

  2 cups flour
  1 tablespoon baking powder
  1 teaspoon salt
  ⅓ cup shortening
  About ¾ cup milk

Mix dry ingredients thoroughly. Mix in fat only until mixture is
crumbly.

Add most of the milk and stir to mix. Add more milk as needed to make a
dough that is soft but not too sticky to knead. Knead dough gently on a
lightly floured surface 10 to 12 times. Form into a ball.

Pat or roll dough to ½- to ¾-inch thickness. Cut with a floured biscuit
cutter or cut into squares with a knife. Place on an ungreased baking
sheet—1 inch apart for crusty biscuits; together for softer biscuits.

Bake at 450° F. (very hot oven) 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown.

Desserts


Dessert adds a touch that gives a good dinner its final, satisfying
note.

Before using the dessert recipes in this bulletin, refer to the section
on ingredients and measurements (p. 16).

Cake recipes in this publication generally need to be adapted for use
in high-altitude areas. Write to your State Experiment Station or
contact your county extension agent for information on baking cakes in
your area.

For pies and cakes, use pans of the size specified.

To grease pans for cakes, coat lightly with unsalted fat or oil. Then
sprinkle lightly with a little flour. Tip pan from side to side to coat
evenly; then shake out excess flour.

In recipes that call for greased and floured cakepans, you may use a
wax paper lining if you prefer. Cut wax paper to fit the bottom of the
pan. Then grease the paper lightly.


Pastry

  ½ teaspoon salt
  ⅓ cup shortening

Add a little water at a time, blending lightly. Dough should be just
moist enough to cling together when pressed.

Shape dough into a ball. Roll out on a lightly floured surface or
between two sheets of waxed paper. Fit carefully into piepan. Lift
edges and smooth out air bubbles. For baked pastry shell, trim pastry,
leaving about 1 inch around the edge. Fold edge under and shape into an
upright rim.

Prick bottom and sides well with a fork. Bake at 450° F. (very hot
oven) 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown.

cup granulated sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. Beat sugars with butter or
margarine. Omit the chocolate. Stir ⅔ cup chopped nuts and 1 package
(12 ounces) chocolate chips into the dough. Drop dough from a teaspoon
onto an ungreased baking sheet and bake as directed.


Apple crisp

_6 servings_

  ⅛ teaspoon salt
  ¼ teaspoon cinnamon
  ¼ teaspoon nutmeg
  ⅓ cup brown sugar, packed
  3 tablespoons softened butter or margarine

Baked apples

_6 servings_

  6 large baking apples
  6 tablespoons sugar
  2 tablespoons butter or margarine
  Cinnamon, as desired
  ½ cup water

Wash and core apples. Pare apples one-third of the way down or slit the
skin around the apple about half-way down.

Place apples in a baking dish. Put sugar and butter or margarine in the
center of each apple. Sprinkle with cinnamon. Pour the water around
apples to prevent sticking.

Bake uncovered at 400° F. (hot oven) until tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour.


_Variation_

_Cranberry-baked apples._—Omit the sugar, fat, and cinnamon. Combine

  1 cup sugar
  2 eggs, slightly beaten
  1 teaspoon vanilla
  ⅔ cup flour
  ½ teaspoon baking powder
  ½ teaspoon salt
  ½ cup chopped nuts

Melt chocolate and fat together over low heat. Cool slightly. Mix sugar
with eggs.

Stir chocolate mixture into eggs gradually. Add vanilla.

Mix dry ingredients, stir in nuts, and add to chocolate mixture.

Spread batter in a greased 8-inch square baking pan. Bake at 350° F.
(moderate oven) 25 to 30 minutes or until crust is shiny and brownies
begin to shrink from pan. Cool in pan. Cut into 2-inch squares.

knife inserted in the center comes out clean.


Raisin-nut bread pudding

_6 servings_

  ½ cup slivered almonds
  2 egg whites
  ¼ teaspoon salt

Quick ice cream desserts

_Pecan balls._—Toast pecans by spreading 1½ cups in a shallow pan,
and baking at 300° F. (slow oven) 15 to 20 minutes, or until lightly
browned. Cool and chop. Shape 1 quart ice cream into 6 balls. Roll
balls in pecans. Place on a tray covered with wax paper and return
to freezer until firm. Just before serving, top balls with hot fudge
sauce. Makes 6 servings.

_Snowballs._—Shape 1 quart ice cream into 6 balls. Roll balls in ½ cup
flaked coconut. Return balls to freezer as directed above. Makes 6
servings.

_Ice cream sandwiches._—Slice 1 quart ice cream into 6 slices. Place
each slice between 2 graham crackers (plain, cinnamon-flavored, or
chocolate-coated). Serve immediately or return to freezer until time to
serve. Makes 6 sandwiches.

_Buttered nut sundae._—Add ½ cup chopped pecans or walnuts to 2
tablespoons melted butter or margarine in a frypan. Toast nuts over low
heat for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring as needed, until they are lightly
browned. Stir in ¼ cup brown sugar (packed) and ¼ cup water; simmer 2
minutes. Pour warm sauce over ice cream. Makes about ¾ cup or enough
for 6 sundaes.


Ways to Use Leftovers


Don’t throw good leftover food away. Use your cooking skill—and your
imagination—to make leftovers tasty.

Some leftovers make good second meals merely by reheating. Others are
better prepared in a new way—with seasonings, sauces, crisp toppings.
Try leftover fruit in muffins, vegetables in omelets. Substitute 2
leftover egg yolks for 1 whole egg in baked custard. And soups often
become richer, more delicious when leftovers are added.

Listed below are some of the ways in which leftovers may be used.

Cooking Terms


  =Bake=         To cook in an oven or oven-type appliance in a
                      covered or uncovered container.

  =Barbecue=     To roast slowly on a spit or rack, usually basting
                      with a highly seasoned sauce. Also, foods cooked
                      in or served with barbecue sauce.

  =Baste=        To pour melted fat, drippings, or other liquid over
                      food to moisten it during cooking.

  =Boil=         To cook in water or other liquid at boiling
                      temperature (212° F. at sea level). Bubbles rise
                      continually and break on the surface.

  =Braise=       To cook meat or poultry slowly in steam from meat
                      juices or added liquid trapped and held in a
                      covered pan. Meat may be browned in a small amount
                      of fat before braising.

  =Broil=        To cook uncovered on a rack placed directly under
                      heat or over an open fire.
                        _Pan broil._—To cook in uncovered pan over
                      direct heat, pouring fat off as it accumulates.

  =Caramelize=   To heat sugar or food containing sugar until a brown
                      color and characteristic flavor develop.

  =Fold=         To combine two mixtures (or two ingredients such as
                      beaten egg white and sugar) by gently cutting down
                      through mixture, turning over, and repeating until
                      well mixed.

  =Fry=          To cook in fat without water, uncovered.
                        _Pan-fry or saute._—To cook in frypan in a
                      small amount of fat.
                        _Deep-fry or french-fry._—To cook in a deep
                      kettle, in enough fat to cover or float food.

  =Grill=        Same as broil.

  =Knead=        To press, stretch, and fold dough or other mixture
                      to make it elastic or smooth. Bread dough becomes
                      elastic; fondant becomes smooth and satiny.

  =Marinate=     To let foods stand in a liquid (usually mixture of
                      oil with vinegar or lemon juice) to add flavor or
                      to make more tender.

  =Parboil=      To boil until partly cooked.

  =Poach=        To simmer gently in liquid so food retains its shape.

  =Pot-roast=    To cook large cuts of meat by braising.

  =Reconstitute= To restore concentrated food—such as frozen orange
                      juice or dry milk—to its original state, usually
                      by adding water.

  =Rehydrate=    To soak or cook dried foods to restore the water
                      lost in drying.

  =Roast=        To cook in heated air—usually in an oven—without
                      water, uncovered.

  =Simmer=       To cook in liquid just below the boiling point, at
                      temperatures of 185° to 210° F. Bubbles form
                      slowly and break below the surface.

  =Steam=        To cook food in steam, with or without pressure.
                      Food is steamed in a covered container on a rack
                      or in a perforated pan over boiling water.

  =Stew=         To cook in liquid, just below the boiling point.

FAMILY FARE is a result of USDA research. Here, the Agricultural
Research Service brings together information on nutrition, food
management, and food preparation.

Guidelines for nutritious meal planning and for food management came
from the Consumer and Food Economics Research Division of ARS. Basic
cooking methods and recipes were developed and taste-tested in the
ARS Food Quality and Use Laboratory of the Human Nutrition Research
Division. Fish recipes and information on buying fish were contributed
by home economists in the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, Department of
the Interior.
