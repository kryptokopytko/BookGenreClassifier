Preface.


If the writer can impress upon the readers of this little salad book the
importance of eating salads, the writing of it will not be in vain.

The addition of a pretty salad to a menu not only gives a refined,
attractive appearance to the table, but is appetizing, and, I might say,
almost a necessity in this climate, speaking from a health standpoint.
Fruits and vegetables contain a large amount of the necessary salts
required by the system, and as for olive oil, the many benefits derived
from the use of pure olive oil are so great that it is considered by
good authority a positive beautifier. We all know that celery and onions
are soothing to the nerves.

This is not a very comprehensive work, but a collection of a few
practical, palatable recipes, combined, proportioned and tested by the
author. It is especially written with the hope that it will be of some
assistance to young housekeepers in making their meals attractive and
dainty. With a few exceptions, the materials used in these salads are
produced in Florida.

In making salads there is a field for a great deal of originality. With
a little taste and painstaking care, most attractive, and at the same
time wholesome dishes may be originated.




Important Pointers.


Of course only the freshest and best materials are reckoned in these
recipes. It is a mistake to think the mixing will hide the quality.

Lettuce, endive, celery, and all salad greens should be most carefully
washed, crisped one hour in ice water, put into a cheese cloth bag and
kept near the ice until needed; or, shake gently, put into a covered
stone jar and set in cool place. Cover jar with cloth before putting on
the top. All salad materials should be thoroughly cold and salads kept
cold until served.

Pecans can be cracked easily and meats gotten out whole if they are
scalded and left in the hot water a few moments; crack lengthwise. Scald
nut meats to blanch.

Do not be afraid to use red pepper in salads. It is wholesome and often
prevents them from being indigestible.

Salads should not be mixed any longer before serving than absolutely
necessary.

Onions should be sliced and soaked at least one hour in ice water before
using for salads. They are milder and not so apt to disagree with one.
Cucumbers should be sliced thinly and crisped in ice water one hour
before eating. It makes them more wholesome.

Let the hands come in contact with salads as little as possible. Use
fork and spoon for mixing dressings and tossing salads together. When
convenient make French dressing and mix salad at the table.

A small lump of ice put into French dressing while being made keeps it
cool and makes it milder.

A tiny pinch of sugar improves most salads.

The secret of making mayonnaise that will not curdle is in using
perfectly fresh eggs and cold, pure olive oil. Care and judgment is also
needed; materials differ and have to be used accordingly. Stir in one
direction.

It is best not to use silver or metal utensil in making dressing or in
mixing salads. The writer uses an orange wood fork and spoon. The wood
is hard and does not discolor.

A heavy white porcelain bowl holding about one quart is a convenient
size in which to mix mayonnaise.

Squeeze lemon and strain juice before beginning mayonnaise.

When mayonnaise loosens or begins to curdle, put in a pinch of corn
starch, or if it separates after making, put an egg yolk into a fresh
bowl and gradually stir mayonnaise into it.

The writer never uses cream in combination with salad dressings, from
the fact that lemon juice and vinegar curdle cream. The desired quantity
of the following is a good substitute: one teacupful of fresh, rich,
sweet milk thickened with one teaspoonful of corn starch cooked in a
double boiler; when it begins to thicken add one teaspoonful of butter.
When it is the consistency of thick cream, remove from fire, beat well
and put near ice until needed. It will be referred to in these recipes
as Cream Substitute.

When canned meats are used for salads, the can should be opened at least
half hour before using, meat placed in a porcelain, glass or china bowl
and thoroughly aerated.

Lettuce is so succulent and easy to bruise that breaking or pulling it
to pieces with the fingers is a more delicate way than cutting with a
knife.

Salads should never be sour but so delicately blended that no seasoning
predominates.

“Distrust the condiment that bites too soon.”

A little claret added to Plain Mayonnaise is very nice for fruit salads.

Before making sandwiches, bread may be peeled, or all crust taken off
with a very sharp knife.

Slightly melt butter before spreading on bread for sandwiches.

It is best to spread butter on end of loaf before slicing for
sandwiches. Use very sharp knife for cutting bread.

An ordinary tea cup, level full, rounded table spoon and tea spoon are
used for measuring these recipes.




Salad Dressings.


COOKED YELLOW SALAD DRESSING.

Three tablespoonfuls of vinegar, one scant teaspoonful of salt, one half
teaspoonful mustard, one teaspoonful sugar, white and red pepper to make
rather hot; cook in double boiler and when hot add one half teacup of
butter. When butter is melted stir in yolks of three well beaten eggs
and continue to stir until mixture is the consistency of thick cream.
Take from fire, beat well and put on ice. When thoroughly chilled, fold
in the well beaten white of an egg.


COOKED WHITE SALAD DRESSING.

One cup of fresh, rich, sweet milk. Thicken with one teaspoonful of corn
starch and cook in a double boiler. When it begins to thicken add one
tablespoonful of butter, stirring until as thick as heavy cream. Remove
from fire and add one half teaspoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of
tarragon vinegar, white pepper to taste and beat until smooth. When cold
fold in one egg white, well beaten.


LEMON DRESSING.

One-half teaspoonful of salt well sprinkled with white pepper, three
tablespoonfuls of olive oil and the juice of half a lemon beaten
alternately until thick.


FRENCH DRESSING.

One teaspoonful of salt, tabasco or cayenne and black pepper to taste;
one half cup of cold olive oil, one and one-half tablespoonfuls of
vinegar. Stir oil and vinegar alternately into salt and pepper with an
orange wood fork until thick. Serve at once.

Instead of olive oil, bacon grease is sometimes used. It is then called
German dressing instead of French dressing.


NUT DRESSING.

Pound into a smooth paste pecan meats and mix with French dressing, or
mix peanut butter with French dressing. Nice to serve over plain
lettuce.


MAYONNAISE, PLAIN.

Put yolks of two eggs and one teaspoonful of salt into a cold bowl and
stir until smooth with an orange wood fork; gradually add cold olive oil
and lemon juice alternately until one and one-half cups of oil and the
juice of one small lemon have been used. Season with Tabasco to taste.
This makes a stiff mayonnaise. Lightly fold into it one egg white beaten
dry. If a milder dressing is preferred, mix the above with equal part of
cream substitute. This recipe can be doubled or halved.


MAYONNAISE No. 1.

Two yolks, one-half teaspoonful salt, dash of mustard, sprinkling of
white pepper, a pinch of sugar and six drops of Tabasco. Stir smoothly
and add, a few drops at a time, cold olive oil until it is thick and
cakes on the spoon. Thin with lemon juice and add oil and lemon juice
alternately until one and one-half cups of oil and juice of one small
lemon have been used. A few drops of vinegar may also be added. Cooking
oil is used by some in place of olive oil.


MAYONNAISE No. 2.

Yolks of two hard boiled eggs, one raw yolk, a quarter of a teaspoonful
of mustard, one teaspoonful of salt, cayenne to taste, juice of half a
lemon, a tablespoonful of vinegar and two cups of olive oil. Work the
oil and seasoning gradually into the cold yolks as in plain mayonnaise.
This dressing can be increased in quantity by adding cream substitute.


GREEN MAYONNAISE.

Soak strips of sweet, green peppers in slightly salted ice water two
hours. Drain, chop finely with a sharp knife and fold into mayonnaise.


RED MAYONNAISE.

amount of shredded pineapple. Color the inside of the grapefruit case a
cherry red with a tablet, dissolved in water, that comes with gelatine.
In the bottom of case put a folded lettuce leaf--otherwise it would be
too large--and fill with the fruit mixture.

Top with a spoonful of mayonnaise and a few maraschino cherries. Serve
on lettuce. This is attractive.


TOMATO LILY.

Select large firm tomatoes of uniform size, with a sharp small knife
carefully slice the thin outer skin, separate from the meat, into six
petal shaped sections and curl them back from the tomato. Then slice or
split the meat of the tomato into two rows of petals, making three rows
in all. Bend or curl the petals carefully back away from the center or
round ball of seeds. In the center of tomato or seed ball make a hole
and fill with mayonnaise with a drop of Green Mayonnaise on top. Place
on lettuce leaf. This is a little trouble, but is a dainty, pretty way
to serve tomatoes. It is very necessary to have fresh firm tomatoes and
a knife with a small sharp blade.


GRAPEFRUIT JELLY.

Dissolve one package of gelatine in one cup of warm water, add three
cups of strained grapefruit juice and one tablespoonful of sugar. Let
come to a boil, remove from fire and put into a square porcelain mould.

Dissolve one package of gelatine in one cup of boiling water, add three
cups of claret with one tablespoonful of sugar. Mould in a square
porcelain mould. Put a square of grapefruit jelly on top of a square of
claret jelly and a few red salad cherries stuffed with nuts on top.
Serve with Nut Dressing on large lettuce leaves.


GOLDEN-ROD SALAD.

Tear lettuce leaves into uneven sprays, stripping the stems about two
inches. Dip in French dressing, gently shake and put on pretty salad
plates, one spray on each plate. First cover the sprays with ground
pecans or peanuts and then with grated egg yolks. By the side of the
salad put a ring of the whites of the eggs with a spoonful of deep
Yellow Mayonnaise in them. Serve browned almonds with this. To brown
almonds: blanch them and brown in smoking hot olive oil and butter.
Drain and sprinkle lightly with salt.


SALMON SALAD.

Flake salmon, mix with English walnuts, blanched, chopped celery and
mayonnaise, mixed with a little chopped chow chow. Serve in lengthwise
halves of large green peppers on lettuce.


SAPODILLO SALAD.

Cut fruit in half, remove seed, dress with Lemon Dressing and eat with a
spoon. Serve on lettuce leaves.


CABBAGE PALMETTO SALAD.

Get the tender, white buds from tops of cabbage palmettoes, cut in inch
pieces and soak in ice water one hour. Drain, sprinkle with cayenne and
mix with equal quantity of diced celery. Serve with Cooked Dressing and
a few pearl onions.


PORCUPINE SALAD.

Peel six long firm ripe pears, cut lengthwise in halves and core. Cover
with water, add one tablespoonful of sugar and one of lemon juice;
simmer until tender but still firm. When ice cold, stick the outer side
of each piece full of almond bristles, made by splitting blanched
almonds and cutting lengthwise into narrow pieces. In the large end of
each half of pear put two tiny round eyes cut from maraschino cherries
and in the small end stick a small curved piece of conserved citron for
the tail. Serve on lettuce leaf, one to each person. On side of plate
put a spoonful of mayonnaise with two pistachio nuts in it. Canned pears
may also be used for this salad.


BIRD’S NEST SALAD.

Select large apples, peel and cut lengthwise into shoe strings, or small
as can be cut not to break, letting the pieces fall into a pan of lemon
water. On a white lettuce leaf make a nest or pen of apple shreds and
fill with white cherries stuffed with nuts. Dress with a spoonful of Red
Mayonnaise on top. The apples should stay in lemon water about five
minutes and then put on a cloth to drain before using.


BANANA SALAD.

Peel bananas and slice in round thin slices; squeeze a little lemon
juice over them and mix with equal quantity of blanched English walnuts.
Serve on white lettuce leaves with mayonnaise.


SARDINES IN LEMON JELLY.

Put one small sardine in the bottom of each individual mould or cup and
fill half full of lemon jelly. Just before it hardens put a slice of
firm cold tomato on each and put by the ice. When firm turn out of
moulds on lettuce leaves, tomato slice down; the sardine moulded in the
bottom will become the top of the salad. Put a ring of boned and flaked
sardines around salad and serve with mayonnaise.




Salad Sandwiches.


CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICHES.

Slightly mash chicken salad with a potato masher, mix with mayonnaise
and spread between small squares of white bread.


CAVIAR SANDWICHES.

Mix caviar with Lemon Dressing (minus the salt), spread between buttered
slices of white bread dotted with small flakes of lettuce.


ANCHOVY SANDWICHES.

Mince truffles and olives finely, mash with anchovies and spread on
slice of white bread; butter another slice and put sandwich together
with a leaf of lettuce dipped in French dressing.


PIMENTO SANDWICHES.

Peel a Pullman loaf of white bread and slice in medium slices. Spread
the top of one slice with Red Mayonnaise mixed with mashed tomato, the
lower side of the next slice with slightly melted butter, the top of the
same slice with the Red Mayonnaise mixture and so on until you have four
slices, the top slice to be spread with butter only on the under side.
Of course this leaves nothing on the outside of either the top or bottom
slice. Stack four slices, gently press together and wrap in oil paper
until needed. Slice crossways and carefully lay on sandwich plate.


PEPPER SANDWICHES.

Follow the same directions given for pimento sandwiches using Green
Mayonnaise instead of Red.


YELLOW MAYONNAISE SANDWICHES.

Make in the same way as the two preceding recipes using Deep Yellow
Mayonnaise mixed with finely ground nuts. The three kinds of sandwiches
served together on a large tray look very attractive.


SARDINE SANDWICHES.

Bone sardines, mash, sprinkle with paprika, mix with Lemon Dressing and
spread on slices of white bread. Tear lettuce into small pieces with the
fingers, dot it over the slices and cover with a buttered slice of
bread; press together slightly and cut into any desired shape.


PEARL ONION SANDWICHES.

Butter white bread, cover with minced pearl onion pickles, then a
lettuce leaf, spread with mayonnaise and top with a plain slice of
bread. Slightly press together, trim, and cut in any desired shape.


ONION SANDWICHES.

Prepare white onions by directions in Pointers, mince finely and mix
with French dressing. Put between slices of buttered bread, cut from a
Pullman loaf. Cut each sandwich into three slices, making narrow, long
sandwiches. These are also nice made in the same way, using salt and
pepper instead of French dressing.


PEANUT SANDWICHES.

Mix peanut butter with mayonnaise, spread on thin slices of white bread,
dot over with small pieces of endive and cover with a piece of buttered
bread. Roll, and wrap separately in oil paper. When served unwrap and
slip each sandwich into a green pepper ring. Select small, long green
peppers and cut into rings.


SALMON SANDWICHES.

Sprinkle finely minced salmon with cayenne, mixed with chopped celery
and olives. Add mayonnaise and spread on white bread with lettuce leaf
between.


HAM SALAD SANDWICHES.

Mix potato salad with a little mayonnaise and chow chow pickle chopped
finely; mash all together and spread on thin slices of cold boiled ham.
Butter a thin slice of white bread, lay the slice of ham on it, cover
with a lettuce leaf, trim and roll. Wrap each separately in oil paper
until ready to serve, unwrap and tie with white baby ribbon. These have
to be made very carefully. Slice the ham very thin and mash the salad
smoothly, using very little.


BEEF SALAD SANDWICHES.

Make by recipe for ham salad sandwiches, spreading thin slices of cold
roast beef with tomatoes mashed with Green Mayonnaise instead of potato
salad.
