=DO NOT BUY BAKING POWDER LOOSE OR IN BULK.=—(What is meant by loose
is weighed out in any quantity asked for.) All examinations made by
Boards of Health, Government Chemists, and others, prove loose powders
are, almost without exception, made from alum, and at a cost of about
one tenth of what a pure Cream Tartar powder, like the “ROYAL” Baking
Powder, can be made for. The argument that the consumer will save, in
the purchase of such poisonous stuff, the cost of can, label, etc., is
used simply to enable the seller to make a larger profit in selling
an alum bulk, or loose, powder at the expense of the unsuspecting
consumer, than can be made by selling the absolutely pure “ROYAL”
brand. Remember this, and insist on getting the “ROYAL” in cans.

Do not buy alum baking powders under any circumstances.




                          GENERAL DIRECTIONS

         MUST BE CAREFULLY READ BY EVERY ONE USING THIS BOOK

[Illustration: (Decorative Design)]


HINTS ON BAKING.—To achieve perfect success, the cook must use
discrimination and care. Some flour requires more water, or milk,
than others; so that the quantity may have to be varied to make dough
of a proper consistency. Different bakings will vary as to time and
heat required, and should, therefore, be examined occasionally. To
ascertain whether the bread is sufficiently done in the center of the
loaf or cake, thrust a clean straw or long thin splinter into it. If
done, there will be no dough on it when drawn out. Measure the flour,
and _be careful to mix with it the baking powder in a dry state, and
before sifting_. You can always substitute water for milk, or milk for
water; butter for lard, or lard for butter. The number of eggs may be
increased or diminished, or, in plainer cake, etc., dispensed with
entirely. Where fewer eggs are used than directed, always use a little
more baking powder. _Never use sour milk._

When about to cut new bread or cake, heat the knife very hot; this
will prevent its crumbling.

CAKE BAKING.—For a plain cake made with one pound of flour, Royal
Baking Powder, etc., the time to be allowed in baking would be from 40
to 50 minutes; at the outside not more than 1 hour. Very rich cakes,
in which butter and eggs predominate, take, of course, very much
longer time to bake, a pound cake taking from 1½ to 2 hours, and a
bride’s cake 3½. On no account should an oven be too hot when the cake
is put in—that is, hot enough to brown at once; if so, in 5 minutes
the whole outside will be burned and the interior will stand little
chance of being baked. The old plan of feeling the handle of the
oven door to test the heat is not always successful; it is better to
sprinkle a little flour inside and shut the door for about 3 minutes;
if at the end of that time it is of a rich light brown, the cake may
be put in, but if burned the heat must be lessened.

In baking loaf cake, remember that unless you place a piece of paper
over for protection at first, a top crust will be formed at once that
prevents the raising. When cake is well raised, remove the paper for
browning on top.

ADVICE TO THE COOK.—Great cleanliness, as well as care and attention,
are required from a cook. Keep your hands _very_ clean; try to prevent
your nails from getting black or discolored; don’t “scatter” in your
kitchen; clean up as you go; put cold water into each saucepan or
stewpan as you finish using it. Dry your saucepans before you put them
on the shelf. Scour tins with good mineral soap and rinse thoroughly
in hot water. In cleaning a frying-pan, scour the _outside_ as well
as the inside. In cleaning greasy utensils, such as the soup-pot and
frying-pan, wipe off the worst of the grease with soft paper (which
can be burned), then soak in warm water to which soap-powder or a
little ammonia has been added, finishing with mineral soap. Wash your
pudding-cloths, _scald_, and hang them to dry directly after using
them; air them before you put them away, or they will be musty; keep
in dry place. Be careful not to use a knife that has cut onions till
it has been cleaned. Keep sink and sink-brush very clean; be careful
never to throw anything but water down sink. Do not throw cabbage
water down it; throw it away out of doors; its smell is very bad.
Never have sticky plates or dishes; use very hot water for washing
them; when greasy, change it. Take care that you look at the meat the
butcher brings, to see that it is good. Let there be no waste in the
kitchen.

Bread and Rolls


Bread was first made without leaven, heavy and solid. Then yeast
was discovered, and yeast-risen bread came into use throughout
the civilized world. Finally baking powder was devised, the most
healthful, economical, and convenient of all leavening or lightening
agents.

Yeast is a living plant. Mixed with the dough it causes fermentation
and destruction of a part of the flour, and this produces
carbonic-acid gas. The bubbles of this gas become entangled in the
dough, swelling it up and making it spongy. In this process, however,
a part of the most nutritious elements of the flour (estimated at
ten per cent.) is destroyed in producing the leavening gas; there is
always danger of sour dough, and there is a delay of many hours for
the sponge to rise.

Perfect bread is that in which wheat is transposed into an available
food without loss of any of its valuable properties.

Royal Baking Powder is now largely used in place of yeast to leaven
bread. It does precisely the same work—that is, swells up the dough
and makes it porous and spongy. But the process is not destructive:
the baking powder by itself produces the leavening gas. No part of
the flour is decomposed or destroyed. Moreover, there is no mixing or
kneading with the hands, no setting of sponge overnight, as the loaf
is mixed and ready for the oven at once. Bread thus made cannot sour,
but will retain its moisture and freshness, and may be eaten while hot
or fresh without distress even by persons of delicate digestion.

The ease with which Royal Baking Powder bread is made, its cleanliness
and healthfulness, have caused it to supersede yeast bread with many
of the best pastry cooks.

In making this bread the materials and utensils should be brought
together before the mixing of the dough is begun. The fire must be
looked to so as to secure a steady, moderate heat. Remember to mix
the flour and Royal Baking Powder together before sifting, and sift
thoroughly before wetting.


=Royal Baking Powder Bread.=—1 quart flour, 1 teaspoon salt,
½ teaspoon sugar, 2 heaping teaspoons Royal Baking Powder,*
½ medium-sized cold boiled potato, and water. Sift together thoroughly
flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder; rub in the potato; add
sufficient water to mix smoothly and rapidly into a stiff dough,
about the consistency of cake batter: about a pint of water to a
quart of flour will be required—more or less according to the brand
and quality of the flour used. Do not make a stiff dough as in yeast
bread. Put the dough into a greased pan 4½ by 8 inches, and 4 inches
deep, filling about half full. The loaf will rise to fill the pan when
baked. Bake in very hot oven about 45 minutes, placing paper over
first 15 minutes’ baking, to prevent crusting too soon on top. Bake
immediately after mixing.

* Perfect success can be had only with the Royal Baking Powder.


=Household Bread.=—Sift twice together 1 quart of flour, 1 teaspoon
salt, 2 heaping teaspoons Royal Baking Powder. Make a well in the
center; add gradually sufficient cold liquid—water, milk, or equal
quantities of each—to mix to a stiff batter or soft dough; this will
require about 1 pint of liquid. Turn at once into a greased loaf-pan
(fig. XII), smooth the top with a knife dipped in melted butter, and
bake immediately in a moderate oven about 1 hour. When done take
from the pan, moisten with the hand dipped in cold water, wrap in
bread-cloth till cold.


=Graham Unfermented Bread.=—1½ pints Graham flour, ½ pint flour, 1
tablespoon sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons Royal Baking Powder, 1¼
pints milk, or equal parts milk and water. Sift together Graham flour,
flour, sugar, salt, and powder; add the milk, or milk and water; mix
rapidly into soft dough, which put into greased tin (fig. XII). Bake
in rather hot oven about 40 minutes. Protect loaf with paper first 15
minutes.


=Brown Bread.=—1 pint Indian corn meal, 1 pint rye flour, 1 teaspoon
brown sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons Royal Baking Powder, 1
tablespoon butter or lard, ¾ pint milk. Sift together corn meal, rye
flour, sugar, salt, and powder. Rub in the shortening; add the milk,
and mix the whole into a batter. Put into greased tin (fig. XII), and
bake about 40 minutes in rather hot oven. Protect at first with paper.


=Brown Bread, 2.=—Mix together 3 cups Graham flour, 1 cup wheat
flour, 2 teaspoons Royal Baking Powder, 1 teaspoon salt; rub in 1
tablespoon butter or other shortening. Beat 3 eggs; add 1 cup milk and
1 tablespoon molasses; stir into dry mixture. Add more milk if needed
to make a drop batter. Put into a greased loaf-pan (fig. XII), smooth
with knife dipped in cold water. Bake about 1 hour in moderate oven.


=Boston Brown Bread.=—½ pint flour, 1 pint Indian corn meal, ½ pint
rye flour, 2 potatoes, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, 2
teaspoons Royal Baking Powder, ½ pint water. Sift flour, corn meal,
rye flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder together thoroughly. Peel,
wash, and boil well 2 mealy potatoes, rub them through a sieve,
diluting with water. When this is quite cold use it to mix flour,
etc., into a batter. Pour into well-greased mold (fig. VI) having a
cover. Place it in saucepan half full of boiling water, where the loaf
will simmer 1 hour, without water getting into it. Remove it, then
take off cover, finish by baking in fairly hot oven about 30 minutes.


=Boston Brown Bread, 2.=—1 cup corn meal, 2 heaping cups rye meal, 1
teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon soda, 1 teaspoon Royal Baking Powder, 1 cup
molasses. Mix dry ingredients; add molasses and 1 pint warm water;

steam or boil 3 hours. Uncover, set in oven 10 minutes.


=Boston Brown Bread, 3.=—2 cups yellow Indian corn meal, 1 cup rye
meal, 1 cup flour, 2 cups milk, 1 cup molasses, ½ teaspoon salt, 3
teaspoons Royal Baking Powder. Mix well together, pour into greased
brown-bread mold, steam 4 hours. Dry off 10 minutes in moderate oven.


=Norwegian Bread (for Dyspeptics).=—1 pint barley meal, ½ pint Graham
flour, ½ pint flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons Royal Baking Powder,
1 pint milk. Sift together barley meal, Graham flour, flour, salt,
and powder; mix into firm batter with the milk; pour into greased tin
(fig. XII), bake in moderate oven about 40 minutes. Cover with paper
20 minutes.


=Oatmeal Bread.=—½ pint oatmeal, 1½ pints flour, ½ teaspoon salt, 3
teaspoons Royal Baking Powder, ¾ pint milk. Boil oatmeal in 1½ pints
salted water 1 hour; add milk; set aside until cold. Then place in
bowl, sift together flour, salt, and powder, and add. Mix smoothly and
deftly. Bake in greased tin (fig. XII) about 45 minutes, protected
with paper 20 minutes.


=Peculiars.=—1 pint flour, sifted with 1 teaspoon Royal Baking Powder
and a little salt; add 1 egg; mix with 1 pint sweet milk, beat well to
a batter, and bake quickly in buttered gem-pans already hot.


=Pennsylvania Brown Bread.=—Mix well together 1 quart Graham flour, 1
pint Indian corn meal, 2 scant teaspoons salt, 2 scant teaspoons Royal
Baking Powder. Dissolve 1 scant teaspoon soda in 1 teaspoon boiling
water; mix with 1 cup molasses. To the dry ingredients add 1 quart
cold water, then the molasses. Beat 1 minute, pour into 2 well-greased
molds, steam or boil 4 hours. Dry off on pan in moderate oven 10
minutes.

tablespoon sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons Royal Baking Powder,
¾ pint milk. Sift together Graham flour, flour, sugar, salt, and
powder; add the milk; mix into smooth dough that can be easily
handled. Flour the board, turn out dough, give it a quick, vigorous
additional kneading to complete its smoothness; then divide into four
large pieces, which form into long loaves, lay them just touching in a
square shallow cake-pan (fig. XIII), wash them over with milk. Bake in
rather hot oven 30 minutes. When removing from oven rub them over with
a little butter on a clean piece of linen.


=Corn Bread (New Orleans).=—1½ pints Indian corn meal, ½ pint flour,
1 tablespoon sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 heaping teaspoons Royal
Baking Powder, 1 tablespoon butter or lard, 1¼ pints milk, 2 eggs.

a shallow pan in very hot oven.


=Graham Rolls.=—1 pint Graham flour, 1 pint wheat flour, 1 teaspoon
salt, 2 teaspoons Royal Baking Powder, 1 tablespoon butter or lard, ¾
pint milk. Sift together Graham flour, flour, salt, and powder; rub
in the shortening; add milk, and mix the whole into smooth dough that
can be handled—not _too_ soft; flour board, turn it out, and form into
rolls shape and size of large fingers. Lay them on baking-sheet (fig.
XIV) so that they will not touch. Wash their surfaces with soft brush
(fig. XI) dipped in milk to glaze them. Bake in hot oven from 10 to 12
minutes.


=Breakfast Rolls.=—1½ pints flour, ½ pint Indian corn meal (white), 1
teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons Royal Baking Powder, 1 tablespoon butter or
lard, ¾ pint milk. Sift together flour, corn meal, salt, and powder;
rub in shortening; add the milk, mix smoothly into rather firmer
dough than usual. Flour the board, turn out the dough, give it 1 or
2 turns to complete its smoothness. Divide it, thus prepared, into
pieces size of an egg; again divide these in half, which roll out
under the hand until they are long and half the size of one’s little
finger. Lay on greased baking-tin (fig. XIV) so that they do not touch,
wash them over with milk. Bake in _hot oven_ 7 or 8 minutes.


=Lunch Rolls.=—1 quart flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons Royal
Baking Powder, 1 tablespoon butter or lard, 1 pint milk. Sift together
flour, salt, and powder; rub in the shortening; add milk, mix to a
smooth dough to be easily handled. Flour the board, turn out dough,
give 1 or 2 quick kneadings to give it smoothness. Roll out little
over ½ inch thick, cut out with round cutter about 2½ inches in
diameter; lay them on greased baking-tin (fig. XIV), just touching (in
rows evenly), wash over with milk, bake in fairly hot oven 25 minutes.
Wash them over again with milk when taken from oven.


=Twist Rolls.=—Prepare dough as for lunch rolls. Cut in pieces size
of egg. Roll each with hands into plain roll tapering at ends and 5
inches long. Lay 3 together; begin in middle and braid to end; turn
over and braid opposite end. Mold and twist all the pieces of dough in
the same way. Lay well apart on flat greased pans. Brush with milk,
bake golden brown in very hot oven.


=Dinner Rolls.=—Prepare dough as for lunch rolls, but slightly
stiffer. Knead and roll out quite thin. Cut in strips 3 inches wide.
Roll strips up very tight; they should not be too thick. Lay well
apart on greased flat pans, brush with milk, and bake in very hot oven.


=French Rolls.=—Make dough as for lunch rolls. Knead on board. Divide
into pieces size of an egg. Form each into a short, thick, tapering
roll. Put together by twos, side by side, pinching ends together a
little. Place on flat greased pans. Brush with milk. Bake in very hot
oven.


=Parker House Rolls.=—Prepare firm dough as for dinner rolls. Knead
and roll out ½ inch thick. Cut into 3-inch circles. Press pencil down
across middle of each; rub edges with soft butter. Double each, lay 1
inch apart on flat greased pans. Brush with milk, and bake in hot oven.


=Fruit Rolls.=—Mix together 1 quart flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 2
tablespoons sugar, 2 teaspoons Royal Baking Powder; rub in 2
tablespoons butter. Cut fine ¼ pound citron, seed and halve ¼ pound
raisins. Mix fruit evenly with dry ingredients, make to a firm dough
with milk. Knead on board for a moment, divide into pieces size of
egg, make into long rolls, lay 1 inch apart on flat greased pans,
brush with milk. Bake in a very hot oven.




                   Hot Biscuits, Cakes, and Muffins


Experienced housekeepers agree that breakfast is difficult to cater
for. Even the appetite ordinarily easy to satisfy is likely to be
captious when approaching the first meal of the day. Every article of
food upon the breakfast-table, therefore, should be perfect—the coffee
as clear as amber, the bacon white and crisp, the biscuits flaky,
tender, delicious.

As a nation we approve of hot-breads, and most of all at the
breakfast-table. And while we eat and enjoy them, we have the
satisfaction of knowing that American methods and American cookery
have made them healthful as well as appetizing and nutritious.

And of all the breakfast foods, nothing is so appetizing, so
appetite-whetting, so always dependable, so satisfying, as the light,
flaky, hot biscuit, with a crisp, brown crust, just from the oven,
broken apart without use of knife, and spread with butter; or, to top
off the meal, with honey, jam, or marmalade.

The very simplicity of the methods of making and the familiar,
every-day use of this little hot bread-morsel have, however, sometimes
led to lack of care in its preparation, so that we too seldom find it
in perfection upon our tables.

It is the object of this chapter to stimulate an interest in and
awaken a love for this most healthful and economical of our purely
American foods, so that it will be found, as it deserves to be, a
prominent part of every day’s food in every household.

With a basis of flour, salt, and Royal Baking Powder, we can add other
ingredients to vary and enrich the cakes and biscuits generally known
to the housewife, and produce in almost endless variety breakfast and
luncheon foods that shall be dainty and delicious or substantial and
hearty.

Are eggs scarce and high, does too much shortening disagree with some
member of the family, Royal Baking Powder permits the lessening of
both or either of these ingredients, without impairing the delicacy or
digestibility of the finished biscuit.

Royal Baking Powder is pure and healthful, and its use in excess can
produce no harm; yet for cooking results it is best to be guided by
the quantity specified in the receipts. Baking powder could be added
until a dry, powdery biscuit resulted.

The mixing of the baking powder, flour, and other dry ingredients
should be thorough. This is imperative if a delicate, evenly leavened
biscuit is wanted. The other ingredients can then be added, following
the special directions as given in each receipt.

In using shortening for biscuits, especially through the winter
season, with some limitation, good, sweet home-made lard may take
the place of butter. Butter will color slightly yellow; lard will
whiten the biscuits. This substitution will not do when considerable
shortening is called for, as in cake; but in receipts where the
quantity does not exceed 2 ounces or tablespoons to the quart of
flour, butter may, in the majority of cases, be replaced by lard
without impairing the taste.

Biscuits are mixed to a soft dough, which is turned out, patted down
or rolled to a proper thickness, and then cut out and baked. From long
experience it has been found that the result is much better and the
food more digestible when the finished biscuit is small and not too
thick. The scientific reason for this is that the oven heat necessary
for biscuit, if they are made very large, will brown the outside
before the center is as thoroughly baked as it ought to be. The dough
should be rolled out until ½ inch thick; the biscuits should be of
medium size,—2 inches or less across,—and placed slightly apart in
the pans. A favorite cutter of expert biscuit-makers is the open end
(not the cover) of a ¼-pound Royal Baking Powder can. A good oven heat
will bake the biscuit perfectly in from 15 to 20 minutes, and even a
dyspeptic can eat them without fear of consequences. The biscuit may,
of course, be made thicker or thinner, as more or less of the soft
inside part may be preferred, but the time of baking must be regulated
accordingly.

The same directions will apply to hot baking powder breads made with a
batter. If baked in a sheet the batter should rarely be more than an
inch deep in the pan, sometimes less; if in cups or molds they should
not be more than ⅔ full. This allows the heat to penetrate the mixture
quickly; the moisture and heat start the baking powder into life; each
tiny grain of the powder acts on the materials surrounding it; the
dough or batter expands, then is stiffened by the heat, and all the
starch grains are thoroughly and evenly cooked.


=Royal Hot Biscuit.=—1 quart flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons Royal

                         Fritters and Waffles


Fritters are served as a vegetable or a sweet, for a lunch, dinner,
or supper, according to the ingredients used in making them. Whether
sweet or plain, the foundation batter is much the same, and, with
some additions, the first receipt given in this chapter can be used
for many kinds of fritters. By the use of Royal Baking Powder a fine
fritter batter may be stirred up in a moment, and a meal which it may
be thought necessary to extend, perhaps because of unexpected guests,
can be embellished by the addition of a delicate and tasty dish.

A fritter batter which is to be used as a medium for whole or sliced
fruit should be quite thin, as it is to serve as a cover for the
fruit. When chopped fruits or vegetables are stirred in, or the batter
is to be used plain, it should be thick enough to retain its shape
when dropped by spoonfuls into the frying-kettle. The fat should be
deep enough to cover the fritters, and it should be smoking hot when
used. Each fritter will at first sink to the bottom of the kettle;
then, as the heat starts the baking powder into action and the dough
begins to swell, it will rise to the surface, and should be gently
turned, the turning to be repeated until the fritter is finely
colored. Most fritters are done within five minutes, the time needed
to cook them being determined by one which should be cooked as a
tester.

The very word “waffles” brings to our minds a host of pleasant
recollections. The only drawback, in the old days, was that they
must be started so long before they were ready for the irons, for
home-made yeast took time to raise the batter to the requisite degree
of lightness. Now, by the use of Royal Baking Powder, they can be
prepared in five minutes. They are better than of old, too, for there
is no yeasty taste to them; they are light, tender, and toothsome,
and, what is most important, entirely digestible and wholesome.


=Plain Fritter Batter.=—1 cup flour, ½ teaspoon Royal Baking Powder, ¼
teaspoon salt, 2 eggs, 1 cup milk. Sift dry ingredients together; add

                         Griddle Cakes, Etc.


The griddle cake as made to-day with Royal Baking Powder is another
article of food which has taken high rank upon the American table.
The heavy, sour, grease-soaked, indigestible griddle cake of old is,
where modern methods are employed, a thing of the past. The properly
made griddle cake is a delicious food, healthful, appetizing, and
nutritious.

Raising the griddle cake with yeast is altogether obsolete with expert
cooks. Mixtures of soda, saleratus, sour milk, buttermilk, etc., are
likewise not permissible. Royal Baking Powder has altogether redeemed
the griddle cake. It makes the cake light, tender, digestible, and its
preparation and baking are the work of a moment only.

Royal Baking Powder, plain, sweet milk, flour, and a little salt make
a food fit for a feast. What so simple, so easily prepared? Eggs are
altogether unessential.

The batter must be thin, the cakes made small and not too thick,—about
a good ⅛ inch thick when baked,—browned, and neatly turned. The
griddle must be merely rubbed with grease, not grease-soaked. This
is highly important. Take a thick piece of salt pork on a fork, or a
lump of suet in a piece of cheese-cloth, and rub lightly over the hot
griddle and pour the batter on immediately.

Remember that buckwheat is one of the most difficult flours to
lighten. Where it enters into combination with other materials this
fact must be recognized and a somewhat larger proportion of Royal
Baking Powder allowed. Made in the manner directed in these receipts
buckwheat cakes can be safely and profusely eaten by every one.

=Royal Buckwheats.=—This is the most delicious of all the griddle
cakes. It has been against buckwheat cakes when made from yeast or
risen overnight that it was difficult to make them light and sweet,
and that disagreeable effects followed their eating. It is found
that by the use of the Royal Baking Powder to raise the batter these
objections have been entirely overcome, and that buckwheat cakes
are made a most delicious food, light, sweet, tender, and perfectly
wholesome, that can be eaten by any one without the slightest
digestive inconvenience. 2 cups pure buckwheat (do not use the
so-called “prepared” or “self-raising” flours), 1 cup wheat flour,

Flour

Fancy-cake makers and confectioners prefer to use “pastry” flour for
the making of cakes and pastry, which is a flour of different grade
from that used for bread and general baking purposes. Bread flour
contains a large proportion of gluten, the nitrogenous property of the
wheat grain, which gives bone and muscle, and makes bread a nutritious
food. When bread flour is used for cake and pie crust the result is
not quite as flaky and light as it should be, because of the gluten in
the flour. A special sack of pastry flour for use in making fine cakes
and pastry will be advantageous. In appearance pastry flour is whiter
than bread flour. When rubbed between the fingers it feels as soft and
fine as corn-starch; if squeezed in the hand it forms a firm ball.
Because of this tendency to “pack” it should always be sifted very
thoroughly.

Generally speaking, Royal Baking Powder used with any good flour will
make satisfactory cake which will be creditable to any housekeeper.


Royal Baking Powder

In no department of cookery is Royal Baking Powder of greater use and
importance than in making fine cake. Eggs are too expensive nowadays
to be used as lavishly as they were a generation ago—ten or more to
a cake. Not as a substitute wholly, but as an accessory,—as an aid
toward producing the lightness and digestibility of the food,—we use
the Royal Baking Powder. We thereby obtain uniformly good results and
do a large amount of work at a minimum expense. The quantity called
for by the receipt should be thoroughly mixed with the flour before
the latter is sifted.

The Royal Baking Powder has worked a revolution in cake-making. It
is now no trouble to make at home the finest cakes in almost endless
variety, which shall rival the productions of the confectioner. If you
follow these directions there will be no spoiled or heavy cakes, no
wasted materials through failures in mixing or baking.


To Mix Cakes Containing Butter

Cream the butter, beating till light. Gradually add the sugar, beating
till light and creamy. Add the yolks of eggs beaten till light, then
the flavoring. Beat in alternately the liquid and flour, the latter
mixed with salt and baking powder. Lastly, add the beaten whites, and
fruit, if used.


To Mix Cakes Containing No Butter

Beat the egg yolks until very light and thick. Add the sugar
gradually, beating till very light and spongy. Add the flavoring and
liquid, if used. Have the whites of eggs whipped to a stiff froth.
Add them alternately with the sifted flour (mixed with baking powder),
and cut both in very lightly and quickly.


To Bake Cakes

Thin cakes need a hotter oven than loaf cakes. Cakes without butter
(sponge cakes) should have a more moderate, longer baking than cakes
of same size containing butter. The process of baking may be divided
into four periods or quarters of time: in first quarter the cake
begins to rise; in second quarter it is still rising and begins to
color; in third quarter it browns all over; in last quarter it shrinks
from sides of pan.

To test, insert a clean broom-straw into the middle of the cake; if it
comes out clean, the cake is done. Hold the pan to the ear; it should
scarcely “sing.”

Line loaf-cake pans with buttered paper; fruit cakes need several
thicknesses of the same.

Do not use sour milk, buttermilk, or any of the so-called prepared or
self-raising flours.

                          Fruit Short Cakes


The old-fashioned fruit short cakes were generally made with flour,
soda, sour milk, and shortening, and were restricted to the strawberry
season. We now use Royal Baking Powder for lightening them, employ all
the fruits of the various seasons, and thus feast ourselves upon the
delicate confections almost the whole year through. The short cake
made with Royal Baking Powder and sweet milk is incomparably better,
surer, and more healthful than the old-fashioned concoction. Too much
skill was required in combining soda and sour milk. The milk had to be
at just the right stage of sourness; not a grain more of soda could be
used than was sufficient to neutralize the acid in the milk, or the
cake would be yellow, with a disagreeable odor and soapy taste; if
too little, the cake was heavy. But even the young or inexperienced
housekeeper will find that with Royal Baking Powder a perfect short
cake is an easy and agreeable task. The baking powder only needs to be
thoroughly sifted with the flour, so that it may evenly lighten the
cake. Use sweet milk always. For the old-fashioned short cake no eggs
are needed, the dough being put together in the same way as for baking
powder biscuit.

Throughout the summer fresh fruit of all kinds can be used. With cold
weather substitutes are found in tropical fruits such as bananas and
oranges, stewed fruits such as prunes, dried, and all varieties of
canned fruits; but it is better to keep the fruit short cake for those
seasons when ripe, fresh fruits are obtainable.

The cake part for a fruit short cake may be made from any one of the
following receipts:


=Short Cake.=—1 quart flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 heaping teaspoons
Royal Baking Powder, 2 tablespoons butter, 1 pint milk. Sift the
flour, salt, and powder together, rub in the butter cold; add the
milk and mix into a smooth dough, just soft enough to handle; divide
in half, and roll out to the size of breakfast-plates; lay on a
greased baking-tin (fig. XIV), and bake in hot oven 20 minutes;
separate the cakes without cutting, as cutting makes them heavy.


=Short Cake, 2.=—1 quart flour, ½ cup butter, ½ teaspoon salt, 1
tablespoon sugar, 2 heaping teaspoons Royal Baking Powder, milk to
make soft dough. Mix as in first receipt, and bake.


=Short Cake, 3.=—1 pint flour, 3 tablespoons butter, ½ teaspoon salt,
2 teaspoons sugar, 2 scant teaspoons Royal Baking Powder, milk to mix
to stiff batter. Sift dry ingredients; add milk to make very thick
batter in which spoon will stand upright. Turn into shallow greased
pan (fig. XIII), and steam 30 minutes; place in hot oven 10 minutes.
When cold split in 2 or 3 thicknesses.


=Short Cake, 4.=—Cream ½ cup butter and 1 cup sugar. Add 2 well-beaten
eggs, ½ teaspoon salt; then, alternately, ½ cup milk and 2 cups flour

                        Doughnuts and Crullers


These old-fashioned “fried cakes,” as they used to be called, need the
addition of Royal Baking Powder to make them light. By its use less
shortening is necessary and the cakes are more tender and far more
digestible. After it is mixed with the flour the other ingredients
are added and the dough quickly rolled out, cut, and at once cooked.
The fat should be in a deep pot (to obviate any danger of boiling
over), and should be of sufficient depth to cover the dough when first
dropped in. It should be smoking hot, or the dough will absorb grease
and be soggy. Not more than half a dozen should be dropped in at one
time, or the fat will be unduly cooled and some of the cakes submerged
during the entire cooking; in which case the cakes when cooked will
be greasy and not light. One or two pieces of dough should be cooked
first as testers. When done the cakes should be drained on unglazed
paper, then rolled in powdered sugar.


=Doughnuts.=—Beat well together 2 eggs and 2 cups granulated sugar.

Receipts for making dumplings for a stew or fricassee frequently call
for shortening. This is a mistake, and usually results in heavy, soggy
dumplings. Heaviness may also be caused by a removal of the lid of pot
or steamer before the dumplings are done. Flour, salt, Royal Baking
Powder, and sweet milk are all that are needed to make tender, fluffy
dumplings of this kind. The dry ingredients should be sifted carefully
together, then quickly mixed with the milk. During the cooking the
liquid in pot or steamer should be kept at a steady boil. No more
batter or dough should be dropped in at one time than will cover the
surface of the liquid or rest on top of the meat, for, if too many
dumplings are dropped in at once, those underneath are sure to be
soggy. The cover should not be lifted until the dumplings are done.

minutes.


=Dumplings for Stews.=—Mix and sift 1 pint flour, 2 teaspoons Royal
Baking Powder, ½ teaspoon salt. Mix to soft dough with milk. Turn
on board, roll out 1 inch thick, cut in small circles. Roll each in
flour, drop on top simmering stew. Cover, cook 20 minutes without
opening pot.


=Dumplings for Stews, 2.=—Mix 2 cups flour, 1 teaspoon Royal Baking
Powder, ⅓ teaspoon salt. Add milk to mix to thick batter. Drop by

milk to mix to stiff paste. Flour hands and make into balls. Wring
small cloths in hot water, dust with flour, lay ball in each and tie,
leaving room to swell. Cook in rapidly boiling water 45 minutes, and
serve with liquid sauce (see Sauces).

nutmeg to taste; form into balls about size of a small apple, put into
boiling water, which has been well salted, boil 15 minutes; take out
with skimmer, and serve with any kind of fricassee or pot-roast.

                                 Pies


The richest pastry for pies is called puff paste, and much skill
and practice are required to make it flaky, tender, and very light.
First-class puff paste will rise in baking to double its thickness
and be in light, flaky layers and without greasiness. The novice must
learn to handle it as lightly and little as possible in rolling and
turning. It should be put in the ice-box as soon as made and stand at
least twelve hours before being used.

Pastry flour should always be used for pie crust. It is whiter than
bread flour and when rubbed between the fingers it feels very smooth
and soft, like corn-starch. Carefully sift before using.

Where it is desired to have a plainer pastry, or one less troublesome
to make and more economical, the use of a small quantity of Royal
Baking Powder will give a light and tender crust. As in other cases,
the baking powder must be mixed and sifted with the flour before the
shortening is added. Sweet home-made lard may be used in place of
butter, either wholly or in part, giving a less expensive but equally
good and light paste. Never use sour milk or so-called prepared or
self-raising flours.


=Paste for Pies.=—3 cups sifted flour, ½ teaspoon Royal Baking Powder,
large pinch salt, 1 cup cream, ½ cup butter. Sift flour, salt, and
powder together; add the cream; mix into smooth, rather firm paste;
flour the board, roll it out thin; spread the butter on it evenly,
fold in three; roll out thin, and fold in three; repeat twice more and
use.


=Paste, 2.=—3 cups flour, ½ teaspoon Royal Baking Powder, ½ pound beef
suet, freed of skin and chopped very fine, 1 cup water. Place the
flour, sifted with the powder, in bowl; add suet and water; mix into
smooth, rather firm dough.


=Paste, 3.=—3 cups sifted flour, ½ cup lard, 1½ cups butter, ½
teaspoon Royal Baking Powder, 1 cup water. Cut lard into flour, sifted
with powder; mix into smooth, firm paste with the water; place it
to cool for 15 minutes; meanwhile press milk and salt from butter
by pressing in clean, wet towel, and flour it. Roll out dough on
well-floured board; place butter on it; fold dough over it, completely
covering butter; roll it out lightly to ½ inch in thickness, turn it
over, fold each end to middle, flour it, roll out again; fold ends to
middle, and turn it; repeat this 3 times more, and use. If this paste
is made in summer, put on ice after each operation of folding and
rolling.


=Paste, 4.=—5 cups flour, 1 cup butter, 1 cup lard, 1 cup water, ½
teaspoon Royal Baking Powder. Sift flour with powder; rub in lard and
butter cold; add the water; mix into a smooth, lithe dough.


=Paste, 5 (Puff Paste).=—3 cups sifted flour, 2 cups butter, 1 egg
yolk, a little salt. This is difficult to make. The essentials are:
A cool place to make it in, ice broken up in 2 shallow cake pans,
good flour, and butter, firm, with salt and buttermilk worked out.
Sift flour on pastry slab, form it in a ring with back of your hand.
Place in center the egg yolk and salt; add a little ice-water, and
from inside of ring gradually take flour, adding a little at a time,
as you require it, more ice-water, about a cup altogether, until you
have smooth, fine paste, very tenacious and lithe. Place in ice-box 15
minutes, then roll out to size of a dinner-plate; lay on it butter,
and wrap over it edges of dough, carefully covering it; turn it upside
down, roll out very thin; then turn face down—the face is side of
paste next to rolling-pin—folding it in three, squarely; repeat this
_three times more_, placing it in thin tin on the broken ice, and
other tin containing ice _on it_, after each turn or operation of
folding and rolling. By this method this difficult puff paste may be
made successfully in hottest weather.

to a common custard pie. Beat 1 egg to a stiff froth, then add
pulverized sugar and grated chocolate with ½ teaspoon extract vanilla;
spread this on the top of the pie and let it harden for a moment
in the oven. Or you may prepare it in still another way. Put the

take from fire; add flavoring when cooled. If pearl or lump tapioca is
used, it must be soaked in cold water for several hours before cooking.


=Apple Snow.=—Core, quarter, and steam 3 large, sour apples. Rub
through sieve, cool; whip whites 3 eggs to very stiff froth with ½ cup
powdered sugar, gradually add apple, and whip long time till white and
stiff. Pile in dish, garnish with dots currant jelly.


=Snow Eggs.=—To whites 5 eggs add pinch salt, and whip to very
stiff froth; gradually add 1 tablespoon powdered sugar and few
drops flavoring. Scald 1 quart milk in large pan. Shape whites in

=Iced Fruits for Desserts.=—Any desirable fruit may be easily iced
by dipping first in the beaten white of an egg, then in sugar
finely pulverized, and again in egg, and so on until you have the
icing of the desired thickness. For this purpose oranges or lemons
should be carefully pared, and all the white inner skin removed
that is possible, to prevent bitterness; then cut either in thin
horizontal slices if lemons, or in quarters if oranges. For cherries,
strawberries, currants, etc., choose the largest and finest, leaving
stems out. Peaches should be pared and cut in halves, and sweet, juicy
pears may be treated in the same way, or look nice when pared, leaving
on the stems, and iced. Pineapples should be cut in thin slices, and
these again divided into quarters.

gradually, mixing well, a cup of the hot milk. Put into saucepan and
boil until it begins to thicken. When cool, flavor and pour into a
glass dish. Heap upon top meringue of whites whipped until you can cut
it, into which you have beaten the jelly, a teaspoon at a time.

All water ices are made in this way, varying the proportion of sugar
according to the acidity of the fruit used. Canned fruit syrups may be
substituted for fresh fruit juice.


=Biscuit Glacé.=—1½ pints cream, 12 ounces sugar, yolks of 8 eggs, and
1 tablespoon extract vanilla. Take 6 ounces crisp macaroons, pound
in mortar to dust. Mix cream, sugar, eggs, and extract. Place on

                        Canning and Preserving


=Canning.=—The important points to be observed in canning are, to use
only sound, ripe fruit; to have hot syrup and air-tight jars; to fill
jars to overflowing and seal immediately. Jars should be scalded and
tested before using. Patent canners greatly simplify the work.

Pick over the fruit, stem, pare, cut, wash, etc., and pack in jars.
Make syrup by adding ½ pint boiling water to 1 pound sugar. When
clear, bring to boiling point and carefully fill the jars. Stand in
canner or on board in wash-boiler containing water up to shoulders
of jars. Cover and cook according to directions or till tender. Take
from canner or boiler, add more syrup till overflowing, cover and seal
immediately.


                 Amount of Sugar per Quart Jar

                              Canned     Preserved
              Cherries         4 oz.       8 oz.
              Strawberries     8 ”        12 ”

              Cranberries      8 ”        12 ”



=Preserving.=—Preserves require from ¾ to 1 pound of sugar to each
pound of fruit, and ½ cup water to each pound sugar. The fruit should
be simmered in the syrup until tender, a little at a time; skimmed
out into the jars; when all are done the syrup should be brought to
boiling point, jars filled and sealed. Hard fruits like quinces should
be first steamed or cooked in boiling water till tender.


=Jams.=—Jams are usually made with small fruits or with chopped large
fruits; they are cooked with an equal weight of sugar till rich and
thick, then put into tumblers or small jars and sealed.


=Jellies.=—Use equal parts of sugar and drained fruit juice. Mash
and heat berries till juice runs readily, then turn into bags of
unbleached muslin or 2 thicknesses of cheese-cloth and let drip.
Measure juice and sugar. Boil juice 20 minutes. Have sugar in shallow
pan, heat through in open oven. Add to boiling juice, boil up once,
take off fire and pour into tumblers. Fruit like apples and quinces
should be chopped and covered with water, then simmered till tender
before turning into jelly-bags.


=Spiced Fruits.=—These are also called sweet pickled fruits. For 4
pounds prepared fruit allow 1 pint vinegar, 2 pounds brown sugar, ½
cup whole spices—cloves, allspice, stick cinnamon, and cassia-buds.
Tie spices in thin muslin bag, boil 10 minutes with vinegar and sugar.
Skim, add fruit, cook till tender. Boil down syrup, pour over fruit in
jars, and seal. If put in stone pots, boil syrup 3 successive mornings
and pour over fruit. Currants, peaches, grapes, pears, and berries
may be prepared in this way, also ripe cucumbers, muskmelons, and
watermelon rind.

                                Soups


=Soup Stock= is made from cheap, tough cuts. The meat should be cut
in small pieces and soaked in cold water for half an hour to draw
out the juices. Bone is added for the sake of the gelatine which it
contains, and which will give body to the soup. A good proportion is 1
pound each of meat and bone to each quart of water. Use a kettle with
a very tight cover and simmer slowly for a number of hours. Stock is
better when made the day before it is to be used.

seasonings, simmer 1 hour longer, and strain. Next day remove cake of
fat.

To clear stock beat white 1 egg till frothy, add with broken shell to
above stock when cold (after fat is removed); heat slowly and stir
constantly. Boil 10 minutes without stirring; set aside 10 minutes;
strain through 2 thicknesses cheese-cloth dipped in cold water.


=Soups with Pastes or Vegetables.=—Prepare and clear stock as above.

6 hours. Take out chicken and beef; salt and pepper and put into jar.
Strain soup, pulping vegetables through a sieve. Season and divide it,
pouring ½ on meat in jar, and setting in pot of hot water to cook,
covered, 2 hours more. Heat the rest and skim; put in sago, simmer for
½ hour, then pour out. When 2 hours have passed, pour out stock in
bowl; when cold put on ice.


=Bean Soup.=—Soak quart white beans overnight; in morning pour off
water; add fresh, and set over fire until skins will easily slip off;
throw them into cold water, rub well, and skins will rise to top,
where they may be removed. Boil beans till perfectly soft, allowing 2
quarts water to 1 quart beans; mash beans, add flour and butter rubbed
together, also salt and pepper. Cut cold bread into small pieces,
toast, and drop on soup when you serve.

till soft. Rub through sieve. Return to fire, season with salt and
pepper; for each quart thicken with 1 teaspoon each butter and flour.
Boil up again for a few minutes. Black bean soup should also have
a pinch of mustard and a little lemon juice added, and slices of
hard-boiled egg.


=Croutons.=—Trim crust from stale bread and cut in ½-inch dice. Fry
golden brown in a little butter or in a kettle of smoking-hot fat.
Drain and serve hot with soups. Instead of frying they may be browned
in the oven.


=Ox-tail Soup.=—1 ox-tail, 2 pounds lean beef, 4 carrots, 3 onions,
thyme and parsley, pepper and salt to taste, 4 quarts cold water.
Cut tail into joints, fry brown in good dripping. Slice onions and 2
carrots and fry in the same, when you have taken out the pieces of
tail. When done tie the thyme and parsley in lace bag, and drop into
the soup-pot. Put in the tail, then the beef cut into strips. Grate
over them 2 whole carrots, pour over all the water, and boil slowly
4 hours; strain and season; thicken with brown flour wet with cold
water; boil 15 minutes longer and serve.

                                 Fish


=Directions for Preparing.=—Clean fish carefully, slit it low enough
so as not to have any blood on the backbone, but do not make too large
a cut so as to spoil look of fish; wash thoroughly in cold water.
_Great care_ must be taken not to break gall, for it would make fish
bitter. Use good dripping or lard for frying.


=To Broil Fish.=—Clean, wash, and wipe dry. Split so that when laid
flat the backbone will be in the middle, or take the backbone out.
Sprinkle with salt and lay, inside down, upon a buttered gridiron over
a clear fire until it is nicely colored, then turn. When done, put
upon a hot dish, butter plentifully, and pepper. Put a hot cover over
it and send to table.


=Boiled Bass, or other Fish.=—Put sufficient water in pot to enable
fish, if alive, to swim easily. Add ½ cup vinegar, 1 teaspoon salt, 1
onion, 1 dozen whole black peppers, 1 blade mace. Sew up fish in piece
of clean net or muslin, fitted to shape. Heat slowly for first ½ hour;
then boil 8 minutes, at least, to pound, quite fast. Unwrap, and pour
over it cup of drawn butter, based upon the liquor in which fish was
boiled, with juice of ½ lemon stirred into it.


=Creamed Fish.=—Steam 2 pounds codfish, break in flakes, removing
bones and skin. Make 1 pint white sauce (see Meat and Fish Sauces).
Grease a baking-dish, fill with alternate layers of fish and sauce,
seasoning with salt, pepper, chopped parsley, and lemon juice or
a few drops of vinegar. Mix together 1 cup dry bread crumbs and 3
tablespoons melted butter; spread over top and brown in quick oven.

This may be varied by using tomato, bechamel, curry, or any other
sauce, or by adding grated cheese or sliced hard-boiled eggs to the
white sauce; by baking in shells or patty-pans in place of the deep
dish, or by covering with mashed potato or biscuit crust instead of
crumbs.


=Broiled Salt Mackerel.=—Freshen by soaking it overnight in water,
taking care that the skin lies uppermost. In the morning dry it
without breaking, cut off the head and tip of the tail, place it
between the bars of a buttered fish-gridiron, and broil to a light
brown; lay it on a hot dish, and dress with a little butter, pepper,
and lemon juice, vinegar, or chopped pickle.


=Broiled Halibut.=—Slices of halibut, salt, pepper, butter. Cut the
slices of fish about an inch thick, season with pepper and salt, and
lay them in melted butter ½ hour, allowing 3 tablespoons of butter to
a pound of fish, then roll them in flour, and broil about 20 minutes.
Serve very hot.


=Codfish Balls.=—Put fish in cold water, set on back of stove; when
water gets hot, pour off and put on cold again until fish is fresh
enough; then pick it up. Boil potatoes and mash them; mix fish and
potatoes together while potatoes are hot, taking ⅔ potatoes and ⅓
fish. Put in plenty of butter; make into balls and fry in plenty of
lard. Have lard hot before putting in balls.

Variation may be had by rolling each ball in beaten egg, then in dry
bread crumbs before frying.


=Fried Blue Fish, and other Kinds.=—Clean, wipe dry, inside and out.
Sprinkle with flour, and season with salt. Fry in hot butter or sweet
lard. ½ lard and ½ butter make a good mixture for frying fish. The
moment fish are done to good brown, take them from fat and drain in
hot strainer; garnish with parsley.


=Fish Chowder.=—Cut 2 or 3 slices of salt pork into dice pieces; fry
to crisp, and turn the whole into chowder-kettle. Pare 6 medium-sized
potatoes and cut them in two. Peel small onion and chop fine. Put
potatoes into kettle with part of onion. Cut fish (which should be
fresh cod or haddock) into convenient pieces, and lay over potatoes;
sprinkle over it rest of the onion. Season well with salt and pepper,
add just enough water to come to top of fish. Pour over the whole
quart can tomatoes; cover closely and allow to cook about as long as
takes to boil potatoes; then add 2 quarts milk, and let it scald up
again. Season with tomato catsup, and more salt and pepper if required.


=To Fry Brook Trout or any other Small Fish.=—Clean fish, and let them
lie few minutes wrapped singly in clean dry towel; season with pepper
and salt; roll in corn meal, fry in ⅓ butter and ⅔ lard; drain on
sieve, and serve hot.

[Illustration: (Decorative Design)]




                              Shell Fish


=Clam Chowder.=—25 clams cut up, ½ pound salt pork chopped fine, 6
potatoes sliced thin, 4 onions sliced thin. Put pork in kettle; after
cooking a short time add potatoes, onions, and juice of clams. Cook 2½
hours, then add clams; 15 minutes before serving add 2 quarts milk.


=Fried Oysters.=—Select largest and finest oysters. Drain and wipe
them by spreading upon cloth, laying another over them, pressing
lightly. Roll each in beaten egg, then in cracker crumbs with which
has been mixed a very little pepper. Fry in mixture of equal parts of
lard and butter.


=Oysters Roasted in the Shell.=—Wash and scrub the shells. Cook in hot
oven, on top of stove, over red-hot coals, or in steamer until shells
open. Always place them round shell down to retain juice. Serve melted
butter and vinegar or lemons with them.


=Panned Oysters.=—Pick over the opened oysters to remove bits of
shell. Wash quickly in cold water and drain on sieve. Put into
saucepan with 1 tablespoon butter for 25 oysters and a dash of salt
and pepper. Cover and shake over a hot fire until edges ruffle and
oysters are plump. May be served on toast.


=Stewed Oysters.=—Pick over and wash 1 quart oysters. Scald 1 pint
milk. Strain, boil, and skim oyster liquor; when clear add oysters.
Cook till oysters are plump and well ruffled; take from fire, add hot
milk, salt, and pepper.

If desired thicker, rub together 1 tablespoon each of butter and
flour; add to milk and stir until smooth. This may be varied by
addition of a little chopped celery or onion.


=Creamed Oysters.=—Prepare 1 cup thick cream sauce (see Sauces). Pan
1 pint cleaned oysters; drain and add to sauce. Season with salt,
pepper, pinch of mace, and few drops lemon juice.


=Scalloped Oysters.=—Pick, wash, and drain 1 solid quart oysters.
Put in layers in baking-dish, alternating with dry bread or cracker
crumbs and seasoning. When dish is filled add strained oyster liquor
and sufficient milk to moisten. Cover with crumbs, add 1 tablespoon
butter in bits, and bake ½ hour in hot oven.


=Broiled Oysters.=—Pick, wash, and drain large oysters. Dip each in
melted butter, roll in fine crumbs, and broil in fine wire broiler
over a clear, hot fire. Serve on toast with sliced lemons.


=Pickled Oysters.=—2 gallons large oysters, drain and rinse them;
put 1 pint oyster juice in 1 quart vinegar over fire; scald and skim
until clear; add 1 tablespoon whole pepper, 1 tablespoon cloves, 1
tablespoon mace, 1 even tablespoon salt; scald a minute, then throw in
oysters; let them just come to a boil. The oysters should be pickled
day before being wanted, as they grow tough after standing a few days
in vinegar.


=Oyster Pâtés.=—1 quart oysters, minced fine with a sharp knife; 1 cup
rich drawn butter based upon milk; cayenne and black pepper to taste.
Stir minced oysters in drawn butter and cook 5 minutes. Have ready
some shapes of pastry, baked in pâté-pans, then slipped out. Fill
these with the mixture; set in oven 2 minutes to heat, and send to
table.


=Oyster Pie.=—1 quart oysters, drained; pepper, salt, and butter to
taste. 1 quart flour, 2 tablespoons lard, 1 tablespoon salt, mix with
water for pie crust. Butter plate, then line pie-plate with crust;
fill with oysters, seasoned; put over a crust and bake.


=Scallops in Batter.=—Wash and dry large scallops. Dip each in fritter
batter (see Fritters) and fry golden brown in smoking-hot fat.


=To Boil Lobsters or Crabs.=—The lobster is in good season from April
to December, and should be purchased alive and plunged into boiling
water in which a good proportion of salt has been mixed. Continue to
boil according to size about 20 minutes. Crabs should be boiled in the
same manner, but a little more than half the time is necessary.


=Deviled Crabs.=—1 cup crab meat, picked from shells of well-boiled
crabs, 2 tablespoons fine bread crumbs or rolled cracker, yolks two
hard-boiled eggs chopped, juice of a lemon, ½ teaspoon mustard, a
little cayenne pepper and salt, 1 cup good drawn butter. Mix 1 spoon
crumbs with chopped crab meat, yolks, seasoning, drawn butter. Fill
scallop shells—large clam shells will do—or small pâté-pans—with the
mixture; sift crumbs over top, heat to slight browning in quick oven.


=Soft Shell Crabs.=—Fry in butter or lard.


=To Open a Boiled Lobster.=—Wipe off shell, break off large claws;
separate tail from body; take body from shell, leaving “lady,” or
stomach, on shell. Put aside green fat and coral; remove small claws;
remove woolly gills from body, break latter through middle, and pick
out meat from joints. Crush or cut under side of tail, draw meat from
shell. Draw back flesh on upper end and pull off intestinal cord.
Break edge of large claws and remove meat.


=Lobster Newburg.=—Season 1 pint diced lobster with ½ teaspoon salt,
dash cayenne, pinch nutmeg. Put in saucepan with 2 tablespoons butter,
heat slowly. Add 2 tablespoons sherry; cook 5 minutes; add ½ cup
cream beaten with yolks 2 eggs, stir till thickened. Take quickly from
fire.

                                Meats


Broiling

The rules for roasting meat apply to broiling, except that instead
of cooking it in the oven it is to be quickly browned, first on one
side and then on the other, over a hot fire, and removed a little from
the fire to finish cooking. Meat an inch thick will broil in about 4
minutes. It should be seasoned after it is cooked.


Frying

There are two distinct methods of frying: One with very little fat
in the pan, to practise which successfully the pan and the fat must
be hot before the article to be fried is put into it. For instance,
in frying chops, if the pan is hot, and only fat enough is used to
keep the chops from sticking to it, the heat being maintained so that
the chops cook quickly, they will be nearly as nice as if they were
broiled. Frying by the other method consists in entirely immersing the
article to be cooked in sufficient smoking-hot fat to cover it, and
keeping the fat at that degree of heat until the food is brown. It
should then be taken up with a skimmer and laid upon brown paper for a
moment to free it from grease.


Boiling and Stewing

Fresh meat for boiling should be put into boiling water and boiled
very gently about 20 minutes for each pound. A little salt, spice, or
vegetables may be boiled in the water with the meat for seasoning. A
little vinegar put in the water with tough meat makes it tender. The
broth of boiled meat should always be saved to use in soups, stews,
and gravies. Stewing and simmering meats means to place them near
enough to the fire to keep the water on them bubbling moderately,
constantly, and slowly. Salt meats should be put over the fire in
cold water, which as soon as it boils should be replaced by fresh
cold water, the water to be changed until it remains fresh enough to
give the meat a palatable flavor when done. Salted and smoked meats
require about 30 minutes’ very slow boiling, from the time the water
boils, to each pound. Vegetables and herbs may be boiled with them to
flavor them. When they are cooked the vessel containing them should be
set where they will keep hot without boiling until required, if they
are to be served hot; if they are to be served cold, they should be
allowed to cool in the pot liquor in which they were boiled. Very salt
meats, or those much dried in smoking, should be soaked overnight in
cold water before boiling.


Roasting

Wipe meat with damp cloth. Trim and tie into shape if necessary. In
the bottom of pan put some pieces of fat from meat. Arrange meat on
rack in pan. Dredge with salt, pepper, and flour. Have oven _very_
hot at first; when meat is half done reduce heat. Baste every 10 or
15 minutes. If there is danger of fat in pan being scorched add a few
spoons of boiling water. Allow from 10 to 20 minutes per pound of
meat, according as it is desired rare or well done. When done remove
to hot platter. Thicken gravy in pan with browned flour, adding more
water as necessary and add seasoning.


=Yorkshire Pudding.=-¾ pint flour, 3 eggs, 1½ pints milk, pinch salt,
1½ teaspoons Royal Baking Powder. Sift flour and powder together, add
eggs, beaten with milk, stir quickly into rather thinner batter than
for griddle cakes, pour into dripping-pan, plentifully greased with
beef-dripping, bake in hot oven 25 minutes; serve with roast beef.


=Braised Beef.=—Wipe and trim 6 pounds round or rump of beef without
bone. Sear brown on all sides in very hot frying-pan over hot fire. In
braising-pan or iron kettle put layers of sliced onions, turnips, and
carrots; add bunch of sweet herbs, 1 teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon pepper;
on this lay meat. Add 1 pint boiling water (or water and stewed
tomatoes). Cover closely and cook 4 hours in moderate oven. If water
evaporates rapidly add more. Transfer meat to hot platter. Strain,
thicken, and season gravy. The vegetables may be served separately if
desired.


=Braised Veal Shoulder.=—Have shoulder boned. Fill with stuffing (see
Stuffings). Prepare bed of vegetables as for braised beef. Lay veal on
it, add 1 pint boiling water, 1 pint stewed tomatoes, ½ teaspoon salt,
¼ teaspoon pepper. Cover and cook 4 hours in moderate oven. Uncover
and brown. Serve strained gravy separately.


=Broiled Steak.=—Trim and wipe steak, which should be at least 1 inch
thick. Rub broiler with fat, arrange steak with thickest part in
center of broiler. Have fire clear and very hot, but without blaze.
Hold steak close to fire. Turn every ½ minute, that it may sear
quickly. When ½ done season with salt and pepper. Steak 1 inch thick
will broil in 4 minutes.


=Panned Steak or Chops.=—Trim and wipe steak. Heat frying-pan until it
smokes all over. Rub bottom with a bit of fat. Lay in steak and turn
every 10 seconds. Keep pan _very_ hot. Season when ½ done.

Mutton and pork chops, ham and bacon, may be panned in same way.

If hot platter for steak is rubbed with a cut onion it will give a
delightful flavor to the meat.


=Broiled Ham and Poached Eggs.=—Cut slices of boiled ham of equal
size; broil on a gridiron over a clear fire; lay on a hot dish. Lay on
each a poached egg, neatly trimmed, and serve.


=Beefsteak Pie (French style).=—Take a nice piece of beef, rump or
sirloin, cut in small slices; slice also a little raw ham; put both
in a frying-pan, with some butter and small quantity chopped onions;
let them simmer together a short time on the fire or in the oven; add
a little flour and enough stock to make sauce; salt, pepper, chopped
parsley, and a little Worcestershire sauce as seasoning; add also a
few sliced potatoes, and cook together for about 20 minutes; put this
into a pie-dish, with a few slices of hard-boiled eggs on the top, and
cover with a layer of common paste. Bake from 15 to 20 minutes in a
well-heated oven. All dark-meat pies can be treated precisely in the
same way. If poultry, leave the potatoes out.


=To Boil a Ham.=—A blade of mace, a few cloves, a sprig of thyme, and
2 bay-leaves. Well soak ham in large quantity of water for 24 hours,
then trim and scrape very clean; put into large stewpan, with more
than sufficient water to cover it; put in mace, cloves, thyme, and
bay-leaves. Boil 4 or 5 hours, according to weight; when done, let
it become cold in liquor in which it was boiled. Then remove rind
carefully, without injuring the fat; press cloth over it to absorb as
much of the grease as possible. It is always improved by setting in
the oven for nearly an hour, till much of the fat dries out, and it
also makes it more tender. Shake some bread raspings over the fat.
Serve cold garnished with parsley.


=Boiled Mutton or Lamb.=—Trim and wipe the meat. Have ready kettle of
rapidly boiling salted water. Immerse meat, boil hard 5 minutes, then
reduce to gentle simmer. Allow 12 to 15 minutes per pound. Lamb should
always be well done; mutton may be rare. A little rice may be added to
water to keep meat white; if a few vegetables are also added the pot
liquor will make a good thick soup.


=Boiled Corned Beef and Turnips.=—Select a piece not too salt. The
brisket is a good cut for family use when not too fat. Cook beef in
plenty cold water. Bring slowly to boil. Cook 18 minutes to the pound
after it begins to simmer. When fully ¾ done put in a dozen turnips,
peeled and quartered. When both beef and turnips are thoroughly done
dish out the beef, and lay the turnips, unmashed, about it. Serve with
drawn butter, having as a base the pot liquor. Remaining liquor will
make a good soup for next day’s dinner.


=Pork Chops with Tomato Gravy.=—Trim off skin and fat; rub the chops
over with a mixture of powdered sage and onion; put small piece butter
into a frying-pan; put in the chops and cook slowly, as they should be
well done. Lay chops on hot dish; add a little hot water to gravy in
pan, 1 large spoon butter rolled in flour, pepper, salt, and sugar,
and ½ cup juice drained from can tomatoes. The tomatoes themselves can
be used for a tomato omelet. Stew 5 minutes and pour over the chops
and serve.


=Sausages.=—Have ¾ lean and ¼ fat pork chopped very fine, 1 pound
salt, ¼ pound pepper, and tea-cup sage to every 40 pounds meat. Warm
the meat, that you can mix it well with your hands, do up a part in
small patties mixed with a little flour, the rest pack in jars. When
to be used, do it up in small cakes, flour the outside, fry in butter
or alone. They should not be covered while frying, or they will fall
to pieces. They should be kept where it is cool, but not damp. To
prevent sausages from bursting when cooking, never make a hole in them
with a fork while turning them.


=Fried Salt Pork.=—Cut fat salt pork in thin slices and soak in milk
for a few hours. Pour boiling water over, drain, and fry until crisp.
When partly fried they may be dipped into batter (see Fritters), then
finished in the same pan, turning several times.


=Pork and Beans.=—Soak 1 quart white beans overnight in cold water.
Drain, add fresh water, and simmer gently till tender. Put in
baking-pan and place in center, rind up, gashed, ½ pound fat salt
pork parboiled. Mix 1 teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon dry mustard, and 1
tablespoon molasses; add to the beans, with enough boiling water to
cover. Bake 8 hours in a moderate oven, adding more water as necessary.


=Liver and Bacon.=—Cut liver in ½-inch slices, soak in cold water 20
minutes, drain, dry, and roll in flour. Have pan very hot. Put in
bacon thinly sliced, turn until brown, transfer to hot platter. Fry
liver quickly in the hot fat, turning often. When done pour off all
but 1 or 2 tablespoons fat, dredge in flour until it is absorbed, and
stir till brown. Add hot water gradually to make smooth gravy, season
and boil 1 minute. Serve separately.

Few people know that lamb’s liver is as tender and well flavored as
calf’s liver; it is much less expensive.


=Stew, Irish.=—Time, about 2 hours. 2½ pounds chops, 8 potatoes, 4
turnips, 4 small onions, nearly a quart of water. Take some chops from
loin of mutton, place them in a stewpan in alternate layers of sliced
potatoes and chops; add turnips and onions cut into pieces, pour in
nearly quart cold water; cover stewpan closely, let stew gently till
vegetables are ready to mash and greater part of gravy is absorbed;
then place in a dish; serve it up hot.


=Brown Beef Stew.=—Cut 2 pounds beef in small pieces. Melt some of the
fat in a pan, brown in it ½ the meat. Put rest of meat in kettle with
1 pint cold water, let stand 20 minutes, then heat slowly. Transfer
browned meat to kettle; thicken fat with two tablespoons browned
flour, add 1 pint boiling water and stir; when thick strain into
kettle. Add 1 cup diced carrot, cover, and simmer. When half done add
1 pint diced potatoes. Season well with salt and pepper.


=Mutton Haricot.=—Cut 2 pounds breast mutton in pieces, roll in flour,
and brown in drippings. Transfer to a stewpan, add 2 sliced onions,
cover with boiling water, and simmer until very tender. Add 1 pint
parboiled potatoes or 1 pint boiled macaroni and 1 pint shelled peas;
season, simmer till vegetables are done.


=Brown Kidney Stew.=—From a beef kidney cut off the outside meat in
bits, rejecting tubes and purplish cores. Cover with cold water; heat
slowly till steaming, drain, add cold water, and heat a second and
again a third time. To the drained kidneys add 1 cup brown sauce (see
Sauces), season very highly with Worcestershire and catsup, and stand
over hot water for 10 minutes.


=To Roast a Leg of Pork.=—Choose a small leg of fine young pork; cut a
slit in the knuckle with a sharp knife, and fill the space with sage,
and onions chopped, and a little pepper and salt. When half done score
the skin in slices, but do not cut deeper than the outer rind. Apple
sauce and potatoes should be served to eat with it.


=Sweetbreads.=—Scald in salted water; remove stringy parts; put in
cold water 5 or 10 minutes; drain in towel; dip in egg and bread or
cracker crumbs, fry in butter, or broil them plain.


=Veal Cutlets, Breaded.=—Trim and flatten the cutlets, pepper and
salt, and roll in beaten egg, then in pounded cracker. Fry rather
slowly in good dripping, turning when the lower side is brown. Drain
off the fat, squeeze a little lemon juice upon each, and serve in a
hot flat dish.

[Illustration: (Decorative Design)]




                               Poultry


=To Clean Poultry.=—Put 2 tablespoons alcohol in saucer, ignite, and
over this singe the fowl. Cut off head just below bill. Untie feet,
break bone, and loosen sinews just _below_ the joint; pull out sinews
and cut off feet. Cut out oil-sac. Lay breast down, slit skin down
backbone toward head; loosen windpipe and crop and pull them out. Cut
off neck close to body. Make small slit below end of breast-bone, put
in the fingers, loosen intestines from backbone, take firm grasp of
gizzard and draw all out. Cut round the vent so that the intestines
are unbroken. Remove heart and lungs. Remove kidneys. See that inside
looks clean, then wipe out with wet cloth. Wipe off skin with cloth.


=To Truss Poultry.=—Fill inside with stuffing (see Stuffings). Have
at least 1 yard fine twine in trussing-needle. Turn wings across back
so that pinions touch. Run needle through thick part of wing _under_
bone, through body and wing on other side; return in same way, but
passing needle in _over_ bone, tie firmly, leave several inches of
twine. Press legs up against body, run needle through thigh, body, and
second thigh, and return, going round bone in same way; tie firmly.
Run needle through ends of legs, return, passing needle through rump;
if opening is badly torn, 1 or 2 stitches may be needed, otherwise not.


=To Roast Poultry.=—Rub all over with soft butter and sprinkle with
salt and pepper. Place on rack in roasting-pan and put in _very_ hot
oven. Make basting-mixture with ½ cup each of butter or chicken-fat
and water; keep hot and baste every 10 or 15 minutes. Roast 3 hours
for 8-pound turkey, 1 to 1½ hours for fowls. Keep oven very hot. If
fowl is very large and heavy, cover breast and legs with several
thicknesses paper to keep from burning.


=Poultry Gravy.=—Pour off excess of fat in pan. Set pan on stove and
sprinkle in sufficient flour to absorb fat. Stir until well browned.
Gradually add hot water, or the chopped giblets with water in which
they were cooked; stir till smoothly thickened. Season, simmer for few
minutes, and serve.


=Broiled Chicken.=—Singe, split down backbone, and clean. Grease
broiler, arrange chicken on it, crossing legs and turning wings. Rub
inside and out with soft butter, and season. Have fire clear and hot.
Cook flesh side first, holding up well that it may not brown too
quickly. Should cook in about 20 or 25 minutes, then turn and brown
skin side.


=Fried Spring Chicken.=—Clean and disjoint, then soak in salt water
for 2 hours. Put in frying-pan equal parts of lard and butter—in all
enough to cover chicken. Roll each piece in flour, dip in beaten egg,
then roll in cracker crumbs, and drop into the boiling fat. Fry until
browned on both sides. Serve on flat platter garnished with sprigs
of parsley. Pour most of fat from frying-pan, thicken the remainder
with browned flour, add to it cup of boiling water or milk. Serve in
gravy-boat.


=Chicken Fricassee.=—Clean and disjoint chicken. Wipe each piece. Put
in pot, cover with boiling water and simmer till tender. To the liquor
add 1 cup or more hot milk, and thicken with flour dissolved in cold
water. Season well, boil up for a few minutes. Serve with dumplings or
Royal biscuit.

taken off, put in a little onion out very fine—not enough to taste
distinctly, just enough to flavor a little; rub some parsley very fine
when dry, or cut fine when green—this gives pleasant flavor. Season
well with pepper and salt, and few ounces good fresh butter. When all
is cooked well, have liquid enough to cover chicken, then beat 2 eggs

coffee grounds in bowl; pour over about ½ pint cold water and let
stand for 15 minutes; bring remaining water to a boil. Take coffee
in bowl, strain through fine sieve, then take French coffee-pot, put
coffee grounds in strainer at top of French pot, leaving water in
bowl. Then take boiling water and pour over coffee very slowly. Then
set coffee-pot on stove 5 minutes; _must not boil_. Take off and pour
in cold water from bowl that coffee was first soaked in, to settle.
Serve in another pot. The French, who have the reputation of making
the best coffee, use 3 parts Java, 1 part Mocha.


=Vienna Coffee.=—Equal parts Mocha and Java coffee; allow 1 heaping
tablespoon of coffee to each person, and 2 extra to make good
strength. Mix 1 egg with grounds, pour on coffee ½ as much boiling
water as will be needed, let coffee froth, then stir down grounds and
let boil 5 minutes; then let coffee stand where it will keep hot,
but not boil, for 5 or 10 minutes, and add rest of water. To 1 pint
cream add white of an egg, well-beaten; this is to be put in cups with
sugar, and hot coffee added.


=Tea.=—Water for tea should be freshly heated and just boiling. Teas
are of differing strengths, but a safe rule is 1 teaspoon dry tea to
½ pint boiling water. Scald tea-pot; put in dry tea and cover for 1
minute. Add boiling water, cover closely. Let stand 3 to 6 minutes,
strain off into second hot pot. A wadded cozy will keep tea hot for a
long time off the fire.


=Cocoa.=—The usual rule is 1 teaspoon cocoa to each cup. Mix dry cocoa
with little cold water, add scalded milk or boiling water, and boil 1
minute.


=Chocolate.=—1 square unsweetened chocolate, 1 tablespoon sugar, 2
tablespoons hot water. Grate chocolate, boil all together till smooth,
add gradually 1 pint scalded milk, cook in double boiler 5 minutes.
Some like to add 1 teaspoon vanilla. It can be made stronger by using
more chocolate.

                         Cookery for the Sick


Always prepare food for the sick in the neatest and most careful
manner. In sickness the senses are unusually acute, and far more
susceptible to carelessness, negligence, and mistakes in the
preparation and serving of food than when in health.


=Corn Meal Gruel.=—Mix 1 tablespoon corn meal, ½ teaspoon salt, and
2 tablespoons cold water. Add 1 pint boiling water, simmer slowly 1
hour. In serving bowl put 2 tablespoons cream, 1 lump sugar, strain in
gruel, stir for a moment, and serve.

Flour and arrowroot gruel is made in the same way, but cooked only 10
minutes.

Farina gruel is made with milk and cooked 1 hour in double boiler.

Boil oatmeal gruel 1 hour and strain.


=Barley Water.=—Wash 2 tablespoons pearl barley, scald with boiling
water, boil 5 minutes, strain. Add 2 quarts cold water, simmer till
reduced ½. Strain, add lemon juice to taste. Good in fevers.


=Wine Whey.=—Scald 1 cup milk, add 1 cup wine, cook gently till it
wheys. Strain through cheese-cloth.


=Beef Tea.=—Chop very fine 1 pound lean beef round. Cover with ½ pint
cold water. Stand in cold place 1 hour. Set over hot water, stir till
liquid _begins_ to turn color. Strain, add pinch salt. To reheat, set
cup in pan of hot water.


=Restorative Jelly.=—Put in glass jar ½ box granulated gelatine, 1
tablespoon granulated gum arabic, 2 cloves, 3 tablespoons sugar, 2
tablespoons lemon juice, 1 cup port wine. Stand in kettle cold water,
heat till all is dissolved. Strain into shallow dish. Chill. Cut in
½-inch squares.

                               Candies


=Granulated= sugar is preferable. Candy should not be stirred while
boiling. Cream tartar should not be added until syrup begins to boil.
Butter should be put in when candy is almost done. Flavors are more
delicate when not boiled in candy but added afterward.


=Butter Scotch.=—2 cups sugar, 2 tablespoons water, piece butter size
of an egg. Boil without stirring until it hardens on a spoon. Pour out
on buttered plates to cool.


=Cream Candy.=—1 pound white sugar, 3 tablespoons vinegar, 1 teaspoon
extract lemon, 1 teaspoon cream tartar. Add little water to moisten
sugar, boil until brittle. Put in extract, then turn quickly out on
buttered plates. When cool, pull until white, and cut in squares.


=Cream Walnuts.=—2 cups sugar, ⅔ cup water. Boil _without stirring_
until it will spin a thread; flavor with extract vanilla. Set off into
dish with cold water in; when at blood heat stir briskly until white
and creamy, then knead and work with the hands for several minutes.
Have walnuts shelled: make cream into small round cakes with your
fingers; press half a walnut on either side, and drop into sifted
granulated sugar. For cream dates, take fresh dates, remove stones,
and fill center of dates with this same cream. Drop into sugar.


=Creamed Nuts.=—Mix 1 pound confectioners’ sugar, white 1 unbeaten
egg, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 2 teaspoons cold water to a stiff paste.
Shape in little balls, press between halved walnut or other nut
meats. Stoned dates and large raisins may be filled with this cream,
or it may be mixed with chopped nuts, shaped in bars, and cut in
squares.


=Butter Taffy.=—Boil 3 cups brown sugar, ½ cup molasses, ¼ cup each
hot water and vinegar. When it crisps in cold water, add 2 tablespoons
butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla, cook 3 minutes, cool on buttered pans.


=Candied Popcorn.=—Put into an iron kettle 1 tablespoon butter, 3
tablespoons water, 1 tea-cup white pulverized sugar. Boil until ready
to candy, then throw in 3 quarts nicely popped corn. Stir briskly
till candy is evenly distributed over corn. Take kettle from fire,
stir until it is cooled a little and you have each grain separate and
crystallized with sugar, taking care that corn does not burn. Nuts of
any kind may be prepared in same way.


=Cocoanut Cream Candy.=—1 cocoanut, 1½ pounds granulated sugar. Put
sugar and milk of cocoanut together, heat slowly until sugar is
melted; then boil 5 minutes; add cocoanut (finely grated), boil 10
minutes longer, stir constantly to keep from burning. Pour on buttered
plates, cut in squares. Will take about 2 days to harden. Use prepared

             THE ROYAL BAKING POWDER IS ABSOLUTELY PURE.




                                ROYAL

            A STRICTLY PURE, CREAM OF TARTAR BAKING POWDER


The tests made by the Government chemists show that Royal Baking
Powder is of the highest efficiency and usefulness as a leavening
agent; that it does not contain alum, ammonia, or lime, and is
absolutely pure. The official tests by the various State Food
Commissions, Boards of Health, and official analysts show no other
baking powder so pure, strong, and healthful.

More ill health and physical discomfort result from unwholesome food
than from any other one cause, and chief among unwholesome foods are
the alum and other cheaply made baking powders.

The market is full of low-grade powders, mostly made from burnt alum
and phosphatic acid. The sale of these powders is urged by some
dealers because they are bought cheap at wholesale and yield them
large profits. Consumers should _ask for Royal and take no substitute_.

Alum baking powders are classed as poisonous by the most eminent
physicians. They cost but three cents a pound to make, and being sold
at from twenty to forty cents, are also a commercial fraud. They
cause indigestion, heartburn, dyspepsia, and diseases of the liver
and kidneys. Consumers who value their health must be on their guard
against these dangerous powders. It will be safer in all cases to
_demand the Royal and take no other_.

The housewife will find no possible substitute for the Royal Baking
Powder. There is no other baking powder or preparation that will
render the food so excellent in every quality.

=Instead of cream of tartar and soda=, or soda and sour milk, the best
housekeepers now use Royal Baking Powder. It is almost impossible for
the housekeeper to procure pure cream of tartar. Professor Chandler,
when president of the New York Board of Health, stated in an official
report that he found upon investigation that nearly all the cream
of tartar sold by grocers was adulterated with white clay, alum, or
other hurtful substance. These ingredients are dangerous to health,
impoverishing the blood, producing dyspepsia, etc. Professor Chandler
strongly recommends the use of a well-known baking powder (like the
Royal) in all kinds of baking as more convenient, economical, and
healthful.

Royal Baking Powder is sold only in securely labeled tin cans.

=Remember=, in all old receipts where cream of tartar and soda or
saleratus are called for, you can substitute Royal Baking Powder and
get better results.

The usual proportions, old way, are: 2 teaspoonfuls cream of tartar to
1 of soda or saleratus;

Instead of which USE 2 TEASPOONFULS OF ROYAL BAKING POWDER, and mix
it with the flour while dry. This powder is so pure and perfectly
combined that one third less will do better work.

=Never use so-called prepared or self-raising flours. They mostly
contain alum, phosphates, or other injurious ingredients.=




                          THE OFFICIAL TESTS

           SHOW ROYAL BAKING POWDER SUPERIOR TO ALL OTHERS


The United States Government, after elaborate tests, reports the
=Royal Baking Powder= a pure cream of tartar powder of greater
leavening strength than any other.

                                 =Bulletin 13, U. S. Ag. Dep., p. 599.=

The Canadian official tests, recently made, show the =Royal Baking
Powder= highest of all in leavening strength.

                                =Bulletin 10, Inland Rev. Dep., p. 16.=

The =Royal Baking Powder= is superior to any other powder which I
have examined; a baking powder unequaled for purity, strength, and
wholesomeness.

               =Willis G. Tucker, M.D., Ph.D., New York State Analyst.=

As the excellence of a baking powder is dependent upon the yield
of leavening gas, and upon the wholesomeness and purity of its
ingredients, the =Royal= is unquestionably the best.

                                         =Massachusetts State Analyst.=

The best baking powder made is, as shown by analysis, the =Royal=.

                   =Cyrus Edson, M.D., Com’r of Health, New York City.=

I find the =Royal Baking Powder= superior to all the others in every
respect. It is purest and strongest.

                          =Walter S. Haines, M.D., Consulting Chemist,
                                             Chicago Board of Health.=

Our test shows that =Royal Baking Powder= has greater leavening power
than any other of which we have knowledge.

                             =W. B. Rising, State Analyst, California.=

I have from time to time analyzed the =Royal Baking Powder=, and have
uniformly found it to be high in leavening power and to be composed of
pure ingredients.

                                    =H. A. Weber, State Analyst, Ohio.=

My tests show the =Royal Baking Powder= of very superior leavening
power; a cream of tartar powder of the highest purity, containing no
alum, lime, ammonia, or any unwholesome material.

                          =R. C. Kedzie, late State Analyst, Michigan.=

=Royal Baking Powder= is composed of the best and purest ingredients.
It is absolutely pure, with perfect keeping qualities, and as strong
as such a powder can be made. Royal makes the food much finer, besides
assuring its perfect healthfulness.

                                 =G. N. Failure, Kansas State Chemist.=

I have submitted the =Royal Baking Powder= to careful chemical tests,
and find it to be perfectly free from any substance in any way
deleterious or injurious.

                                 =H. A. Huston, Indiana State Chemist.=

=Royal Baking Powder= is free from alum and every adulteration, and it
has a larger amount of leavening gas than any of the others analyzed.

                                  =M. A. Scovell,
                                  Director Kentucky Agl. Exp. Station.=

I have made a large number of analyses of =Royal Baking Powder=,
and have found it to be an absolutely pure cream of tartar powder,
entirely free from alum, ammonia, and all adulterations and
impurities. In leavening power it is of the very highest.

                      =Charles W. Drew, late State Chemist, Minnesota.=

In this market I find but one powder besides =Royal= made from cream
of tartar. =Royal= is the strongest, purest, most economical.

                             =H. H. Nicholson, Nebraska State Chemist.=

I find the =Royal= to be absolutely pure and highest in leavening
power.

                                =Albert Menke, Arkansas State Chemist.=

From actual analysis made by me, I pronounce the =Royal Baking Powder=
to be the strongest and purest Baking Powder before the public.

                                =W. T. Wenzell,
                                Analyst San Francisco Board of Health.=

The =Royal Baking Powder= is superior in regard to purity, leavening
power, and keeping qualities.

                               =Geo. S. Cox, State Chemist, Wisconsin.=

I allow no baking powder other than the =Royal= to be used in my
kitchen, for I know it to be absolutely pure and all that is claimed
for it.

                            =Wm. T. Cutter, Connecticut State Chemist.=

The =Royal= was found the highest in leavening strength, and the best
powder analyzed.

                             =George F. Payne, State Chemist, Georgia.=

There is no baking powder known to us equal to the =Royal=. We
confidently recommend it for purity and wholesomeness.

                                                    =W. Q. Webb, M.D.,
                      President Board of Health, Spokane, Washington.=


=Royal Baking Powder has been found by every examination—official
or competitive—to be the highest of ALL in leavening power, and of
absolute purity and wholesomeness.=
