PREFATORY NOTE.


I have written this book for Young Ladies and inexperienced Cooks, as a
simple guide for them in Cookery. I have had a practical cooking-class
for some time in various towns, where I have proved my recipes by
cooking them for the ladies.

I have been asked to form a book of these recipes, as most Cookery
Books are not suitable for economical households; and the result is now
submitted to the public.

I have learnt from experience what is wanted in a kitchen, and
therefore the instructions given are such that any one can follow them
without difficulty.

I intend, as soon as possible, to publish another little work, with
additional recipes, as time has failed me to give, in the present
publication, all the recipes that I think of importance.

HIGH-CLASS COOKERY MADE EASY.


At the outset we have to remind all who read these pages, that great
pains must be taken to have all pans and dishes scrupulously clean. In
cleaning copper pans, attend to the following directions:--If there are
any lemon skins left from cooking, boil them in salt and water, dip
a piece of flannel in the liquid, and rub your pan well. Then rinse
with cold water, and dry with a linen cloth. Every pan must be rinsed
or dusted out before being used, for the smallest speck of dirt will
destroy a whole panful of sauce; and good sauces are the foundation of
good cooking.

Cooks cannot be too careful in keeping their sauce-pans scrupulously
clean. To clean ordinary pans, place them on the fire with some water
and a little washing soda, and let the water get hot. Then wash out
your pan, rub lightly with a few ashes and rinse with clean water.

Keep a pan for omelets only.




SOUPS.

The first duty of the cook or housekeeper is to have a stock made ready
for soups, gravies, and sauces. On the care given to this point greatly
depend the comfort and success of the dinner. I will now try to explain
how, with a little care and pains, this can always be done, and the
same stock used for several soups. To make--


BROWN SOUP.

Procure a nap-bone, five lbs.; have the bone well broken into very
small pieces, and wash it in salt and water. Cut off the meat, and
brown it in the frying-pan, with an onion. Put the nap-bone and fried
meat into a convenient-sized soup-pot with eight quarts of cold water,
and when it comes to the boil, set it to the side of the fire, to throw
up the scum and grease; remove these as they rise, and boil slowly,
with a head of celery, for six hours; then strain, and have it clear,
to make the different kinds of clear soup. I will afterwards give the
names of these.

For thick soups, or gravies, or sauces, put back the same meat and
bones of the first stock into the pot, and put on eight quarts more of
water. Boil for six hours,--longer, if it is cold weather. Vegetables,
such as carrots and turnips, may be put into the stock, but not in warm
weather. Strain this stock, and it will do for thick soup or purées of
vegetables.


JULIENNE SOUP.

Take the red part of a carrot, part of a turnip, and the white part of
a head of celery, leek, and onion; cut these into thin shreds about an
inch long, and boil in a pint of water. Pour off the water from the
vegetables, and add them to the clear brown soup. Season with pepper
and salt, and whatever sauce is preferred.


PERSIAN SOUP.

Cut carrot, turnip, and lettuce leaves, with a round vegetable-cutter,
to the size of a threepenny piece, and boil tender in a separate
sauce-pan, strain and add to clear brown soup. A glass of sherry added
to the soup is an improvement, but this may be omitted.


MOCK TURTLE SOUP.

Procure a calf’s head, and parboil in plenty of water, with a spoonful
of salt, till tender. When the calf’s head is cold, by steeping in cold
water, trim the head from all gristle, and press it between two ashets
till morning; then cut it in dice pieces. Make a thick soup in the
following manner: take three ounces of clarified fat and one onion, and
brown over the fire; add two ounces of flour, and brown; stir in two
quarts bree of head, keeping stirred gently to prevent burning; draw
over to the side of the fire to boil slowly and throw up the scum. Put
in the pieces of head, and boil if necessary a little longer; put a
glass of Madeira wine in the tureen, and a pinch of cayenne pepper.


SOUP À LA ROYAL.

Switch the yolks of two eggs and the white of one with a glass of
stock, season with pepper and salt. Grease a small tea-cup that will
hold it, and steam for ten minutes. Let the custard stand till cold,
then cut in dice pieces, and drop into a basin of water; and when the
clear brown soup is hot, drop in the dice pieces of custard. Serve with
a flavouring of Worcestershire sauce in the soup.


CURRY SOUP.

Peel and slice one onion, and put into a stew-pan with two ounces of
butter. Fry of a light-brown colour one apple, and as soon as this is
dissolved, mix three ounces of flour, one tablespoonful of curry paste,
and one tablespoonful of curry powder. Then add three quarts of stock,
by degrees, keeping it stirred while pouring in the soup. Let it simmer
by the side of the fire. Remove the scum, and pour through a strainer.
Put back into the soup-pot, to keep hot; and serve with boiled rice.


HOW TO BOIL RICE FOR THIS SOUP.

Put on a tea-cupful of rice to boil in cold water and salt; boil for
fifteen minutes, then strain through a colander. Rinse the rice under
the hot-water tap, and set in the oven to dry. Shake several times to
keep the grains separated. Dish, and hand round with curry soup.


KIDNEY SOUP.

Get one ox kidney, cut it in small pieces and put it on to stew in a
pan with half an onion and an ounce of butter, and let the kidneys
brown; then add a quart of cold water, and let the kidneys stew for one
hour; then strain the stock from kidneys and rinse the scum that lies
round the kidneys; add the stock from the kidneys to three quarts of
second stock, and place in another sauce-pan three ounces of flour, two
ounces of dripping, and brown with onion. When this is browned, add the
stock gradually to prevent it lumping, then the kidneys; let it simmer
at side of stove for half-an-hour; skim off the scum that rises.


PURÉE DE POIS.

Get two quarts of green peas and boil till soft, with a handful of
parsley, in just what water covers the peas. When the peas are ready,
strain the water from them into two quarts of good strong stock, pass
the green peas through a wire and hair sieve, and add to the stock a
glass of cream, and one spoonful of flour.


PURÉE DE TOMATO.

Put into a stew-pan two carrots, one turnip, one onion, two dozen
tomatoes, two ounces of butter, and one quart of second stock, and stew
till tender. Pass this through a wire and hair sieve, if too thick, add
stock to make it the thickness of cream.


PURÉE OF CARROTS.

Boil the red part of four carrots, one onion, with a cup of rice, till
very soft, then pass all through a wire and hair sieve, and add second
stock to this purée to make it the thickness of cream.


OYSTER SOUP.

Use whatever fish bones may be over from filleting fish--failing these,
get a cod’s head, and boil for twenty minutes in three quarts of water,
and strain. Have two dozen of oysters bearded and scalded. Have a
spoonful of butter and one of flour melted, not browned. Strain your
soup, and add it to butter and flour, along with a gill of cream for
every pint of soup. Add your oysters--two for each person--which have
been bearded and scalded, and boil three minutes. Before putting the
soup into your tureen, switch up the yolk of an egg in the tureen, then
pour the soup over, stirring all the time.


WHITE SOUP.

The boiling of fowl, bones of rabbits, a nap of veal bone, or trimmings
of mutton cutlets can be used to make this soup, with a small piece of
mace. For every quart of strong white stock place in a pot one ounce of
flour and half-an-ounce of butter, and melt it over the fire; then add
the boiling stock, a cup of milk, and a gill of cream, and when ready
to serve, have the yolk of an egg switched in the tureen and pour the
boiling soup on it.


HARE SOUP.

After the hare is skinned, wipe it clean on the outside. Great care
must be taken not to lose the blood. Keep the blood in a basin. Place
the hare in a pot with cold water, and a small nap-bone broken; when
it boils, skim and draw to side of fire to boil for four hours; put in
one carrot, one head celery, and one onion. When the hare is done, keep
some of the best parts to serve in tureen, then make a brown roux with
three ounces of clarified fat, three ounces of flour, and the blood of
hare, and brown over the fire; then add the stock of hare, draw to side
of fire to throw up the scum. Skim it well, and pass through a hair
sieve; return to pot and put in the pieces of hare; pepper and salt.
When in the tureen, put in a glass of port wine.


TO MAKE BROWNING FOR SOUPS.

Put one ounce of brown sugar in an iron sauce-pan, and with one
spoonful of water a tiny piece of butter. Stir with an iron spoon till
browned a dark colour. Add a tea-cupful of cold water, and boil for
ten minutes; strain and bottle for colouring soups and sauces. Use a
tea-spoonful to colour your soups and sauces, if not already brown
enough.




FISH.


BOILED FISH WITH EGG SAUCE.

Turn the tail through the eyes, place in a pan and cover with water and
a little salt. Allow eight minutes to each pound of fish. For the egg
sauce, melt one spoonful of butter and one of flour; when smooth, add
gradually one gill of boiling water. Be careful to keep stirring with
back of the spoon till all the water is added. Have a hard-boiled egg
chopped fine to add to the sauce, and serve in a butter-boat. Have a
napkin neatly folded on an ashet, lay your fish on it, and garnish with
parsley.


FRIED HADDOCK.

I may here tell you about boiling lard. To know when it is hot enough
for frying fish, &c., put a small piece of bread in, and if it browns
quickly, the lard is ready. If it is inclined to burn, put in a small
piece of potato.

Cut your haddock up the back and take the flesh from the bones; cut
each side in two, making in all four pieces. Dip each piece first in
flour, then in a little batter made of flour and water, or in a beat-up
egg; then in bread-crumbs, and fry in the boiling lard. Fried parsley
should be served with it.


TO MAKE FISH STOCK FOR SAUCES OR SOUPS.

Take any white fish bones you may have, and put them into a pan with
three cloves, an onion, pepper, salt, a few herbs according to taste,
and a piece of maize, enough to cover a threepenny piece. Cover with
water, and boil slowly half-an-hour; then strain through a sieve, and
set in a cool place till required.


HADDOCK À LA MAÎTRE D’HÔTEL.

Have some filleted haddocks; lay the fillets one across the other on
a plate that will stand the fire, with a small piece of butter on the
top, and some pepper, salt, and chopped parsley. Cover with a greased
paper, and bake in a moderate oven ten minutes. For sauce, melt one
ounce of butter and one ounce of flour in a pan, add a cup of milk by
degrees, and a little cream if you have it, and a few drops of lemon
juice. Dish your fish in a hot corner-dish, with the sauce over it.


MERLAN AU GRATIN.

Have some whitings skinned, with their tails turned through their eyes.
Butter a dish that will stand the fire, sprinkle some bread-crumbs, and
brown in the oven. Serve with a brown sauce made in the ordinary way--a
brown sauce made of butter, flour, and water.


WHITINGS BROILED.

Skin and flour your whitings. Grease your gridiron with a buttered
paper; lay on the fish; keep it a little distance from the fire at
first. Time to cook, twenty minutes. Dish on a napkin, garnish with
parsley, and serve with melted butter in a sauce-boat.


BOILED HERRINGS À LA CRÊME.

Boil any quantity of herrings you require ten minutes in water, with
a little salt; dish them without a napkin. Have ready the following
sauce: Put six table-spoonfuls of cream in a stew-pan, with a little
pepper and salt. When nearly boiling add an ounce of fresh butter and
the juice of half a lemon. Stir it quickly, and pour it over the fish
when sent to table.


TURBOT WITH SPAWN SAUCE.

Cook your turbot as in first recipe; only, instead of cream sauce,
use the following: Get from the fishmonger’s about two ounces of fish
spawn, and pound it in a mortar along with three ounces of butter; rub
through a sieve, place it in a cold place to firm, then put it in a
stew-pan with the yolks of two eggs, a little pepper and salt, four
tea-spoonfuls of lemon juice, half-a-cup of melted butter, and two
tea-spoonfuls of anchovy. Pass it through a tammie, put into a clean
pan and make it hot. Have your fish on a hot dish, then pour the sauce
over it.


TURBOT WITH CREAM SAUCE.

Turbot must be well rubbed with salt and lemon before being put into
water. Have a large fish-kettle, and to every pound of turbot allow a
quart of water, and to every quart of water put in two ounces of salt.
A piece of turbot weighing four pounds will require to simmer twenty
minutes. Lift out the fish with a drainer when done, and cover with a
clean cloth. If sauce is wanted, dish without a napkin; if not wanted,
dish on a napkin, with some slices of lemon and parsley. For the sauce,
put one ounce of butter and the same of flour in a pan and melt over
the fire; add a breakfast-cupful of milk, a little good cream, the
yolk of an egg beat-up, some pepper, salt, and the juice of a lemon.
This sauce may be either poured over the turbot, or served up in a
butter-boat.


SMELTS FRIED.

Dry the fish on a napkin, dip them in very thick cream, and immediately
afterwards in flour, so that it forms a paste round them. Fry them in
very hot lard, dress them on a napkin, and garnish with fried parsley.
No sauce is required.


STUFFED FISH.

Fillet two large haddocks, make a veal stuffing, and spread over the
fillets. Roll up. Sprinkle some bread-crumbs over and small bits of
butter, bake in the oven for fifteen minutes, till brown; pour a brown
sauce over.


MELTED BUTTER.

Place two ounces of butter and two ounces of flour in a sauce-pan and
melt. Stir in two cups of boiling water, switch quickly while pouring
in the water. If rich sauce is required, add one ounce more of butter,
with pepper and salt. This is the foundation of a number of other
sauces such as--egg, shrimp, lobster, oyster, anchovy, giving the name
to the sauce according to what is added. But if it be oyster, the
liquor of the oysters must be added; also a little cream and white
pepper.


CRIMPED SALMON.

Let two quarts of water be boiling in a stew-pan with two ounces of
salt, lay in two slices of salmon (if more salmon is required add more
water), boil quickly for fifteen or twenty minutes. Try the bone in the
middle, and if it leaves easily, the fish is ready. Do not leave the
fish in the water, as it spoils it. To keep a nice red colour, skim the
water while boiling. If it has to be kept, owing to the dinner being
later, put a hot wet cloth over it and set it in a warm cupboard. Serve
with shrimp or lobster sauce.


FILLET HADDOCKS À LA MAÎTRE D’HOTÊL.

Skin and fillet two haddocks, lay the fillets across each other on a
dish that will stand the fire. Sprinkle some pepper and salt, place
some bits of butter on the top, cover with a greased white paper, and
cook in the oven for ten minutes. Serve with sauce à la maître d’hôtel.


TURBOT BAKED.

Cook a turbot as before mentioned, but boil only ten minutes instead of
twenty. Make a brown sauce in the ordinary way, and have some chopped
parsley, chopped capers, and an onion cut in rings. Place your fish in
a baking dish, pour the sauce over it, then sprinkle parsley, onion,
and bread-crumbs, along with some small pieces of butter on the top,
and bake in a hot oven.


PLAIN BOILED SALMON.

Put your fish in cold water (a pound of salt to every six quarts of
water), cover it well with the water, and set it to simmer over a
moderate fire. A fish weighing four pounds requires half-an-hour to
boil, and one eight pounds three-quarters of an hour. Serve with shrimp
or lobster sauce.


SAUCE À LA MAÎTRE D’HÔTEL.

Place in a sauce-pan half-an-ounce of butter, half-an-ounce of flour,
and melt over the fire; then add a tea-cupful of milk, a tea-spoonful
of chopped parsley, and boil for fifteen minutes; then a squeeze of a
lemon and a glass of cream.


SAUCE À LA REGENCE.

Place one cupful of fish liquor in a sauce-pan with the red part of
half a carrot, half an onion, a small piece of turnip cut in thin
stripes, an inch in length. Boil till tender, then add two ounces of
browned flour and butter, pepper and salt. This sauce will do for
stewed fish.




ECONOMICAL MADE-DISHES.


HASH OF MUTTON.

Take some slices of mutton from a cold joint, as many as are required.
Season with pepper and salt, and make a sauce as follows: Place in a
sauce-pan one ounce of flour, one ounce of butter, and brown it over
the fire. Then add a breakfast-cupful of stock. Keep stirring the sauce
while pouring in the stock, boil for a few minutes, add mutton and a
few drops of Harvey’s sauce, and a few green capers. Next, have a dish
with a border of mashed potatoes, or a border of rice; egg on the top,
and brown in the oven. Dish the mutton. In the centre, on the top,
place a few tomatoes that have been stewed in a glass of water, with
half-an-ounce of butter, pepper, and salt. Place the tomatoes whole on
the top of the dish.


HEDGEHOG OF MUTTON.

Boil two ounces of macaroni till soft, and put it on to boil in cold
water. When it is boiled, cut it in short pieces; grease a pint basin,
and stick the macaroni round the bottom and sides of the basin.
Next, take one ounce of butter, one ounce of flour, and brown; add a
tea-cupful of stock, a few chopped mushrooms, a few leaves of parsley,
pepper, and salt, half-pound of cold mutton minced fine, put into a
basin and steam for fifteen minutes, and serve with a brown sauce.


CRISQUETTES OF MUTTON.

Make the mutton ready as above, only have five or six pieces bacon
cut in square pieces, and instead of putting into a basin, put a
tea-spoonful into the middle of each piece. Egg on the top, and fold
in the shape of sausage rolls. Then make a batter with two spoonfuls
of flour and a little milk; wet it gradually with the back of a wooden
spoon, till you get it to the thickness of cream, then switch the yolk
and white of an egg separately; mix both together, and stir in the
batter, and dip your rolls in it--see that the bacon is very thinly
cut, so that it will fry in hot lard. Have some sprigs of parsley fried
to garnish with. Serve any kind of nice vegetables in centre.


STUFFED CUCUMBERS.

Put two cucumbers on to stew, peeled, in a pint of stock. When tender,
take them up, cut them into two-inch lengths for stuffing. The remains
of any cold chicken, or rabbit, or veal will do. Have it minced fine,
with a drop of any sauces liked, such as Mushroom, Worcestershire,
Harvey, and a little flour, parsley, pepper, and salt. Fill up the
cucumbers, place them in the stew-pan to get hot, and serve the gravy
over. Fill the centre with white beans for a garnish.


TIMBALES OF MACARONI.

Boil one ounce of macaroni till tender, then cut it into very short
pieces; take a wire and place it round the side of the timbale moulds,
when greased; make a mince of cold mutton, or chicken, or rabbit; place
a cupful of mince on the fire, with two glasses of stock, pepper and
salt, and sprinkle of dried herbs, a few drops of mushroom ketchup, a
half-ounce of bread-crumbs, and the yolk of two eggs stirred into the
mince. Fill the timbale moulds, steam for fifteen minutes, and serve
with tomato sauce. Fill the centre with potatoes fried, cut the size of
walnuts.


TOMATOES FARCIE.

Take a slice off the end of a dozen of tomatoes, and empty out the
centre; mix it with one ounce of butter, two ounces of chopped mutton
or chicken or veal or rabbit, pepper, salt, Worcester sauce, a few
bread-crumbs. Fill the tomatoes, and stew in a half-pint good stock,
and serve with a little tomato sauce round the base.


DEVILED BEEF.

Take a few slices from cold roast beef, take a tea-spoonful of mustard,
a pinch of salt, a drop of Worcestershire sauce, and a tea-spoonful of
water; mix to a cream; spread over the beef; broil before a clear fire;
a few drops of strong gravy poured round the base.


CHICKEN MERINDS.

Take the legs and wings of a roast chicken, and dip in a batter made
as follows:--Three spoonfuls of flour, one tea-spoonful baking-powder
wet with sweet milk to the thickness of a thick cream. Switch the yolk
and white of an egg separately. Take a few leaves of parsley chopped,
pepper and salt; add to the batter, and fry in a pan of boiling lard or
oil. Serve with fried parsley, and garnish with tomatoes. If garnishes
cannot be obtained serve without.




ENTRÉES.


OYSTER PÂTÉS.

Beard and blanch one dozen of oysters. Make a sauce as follows: one
ounce of butter, three-quarter ounce of flour. Melt over the fire; add
half-a-cup of milk, half-a-cup of cream, and the liquor of the oysters;
strain; reduce the sauce till it resumes the appearance of a cream; add
the oysters, and have a dozen or fourteen pâtés made of puff paste;
bake and fill the pâtés.


SWEETBREADS FRIED.

Lay two sweetbreads to soak in cold water and salt for two hours; put
them on to boil, covered in cold water and salt; simmer slowly for one
hour. Remove all the grit and skin, and cut the sweetbreads in the
shape of a mutton cutlet; pepper and salt, egg and bread-crumb. Dish
with fried parsley and green peas in centre.


LARDED FILLETS OF BEEF.

Take bacon, cut as for larded sweetbreads, and lard in the same manner.
Place a few pieces of chopped suet at the bottom of a stew-pan, half
an onion, one clove, a slight sprinkling of flour, brown, and add one
cup of second stock. Cover with a close lid, and simmer slowly for one
hour. Dish the fillets of beef, skim the grease, and sprinkle a few
mushrooms in the sauce, and serve.


PLAIN MUTTON CUTLETS.

Take one and a-quarter lb. of mutton, divide it into chops by cutting
down where the vein is in the bone. There is a bone at the fleshy end
of the chop, take that off. Take all the fat clean away from the bone;
scrape the bone clean; flatten the meat with a mallet dipped in cold
water, then dip in egg and bread-crumb; fry to a light-brown colour,
and serve with tomato sauce. Garnish with a few tomatoes round the base.


SWEETBREADS SERVED IN BEETROOT PÂTÉS.

Cook two large beetroots cut in the shape of oyster pâtés. Have one
sweetbread cut in tiny pieces, and drop into a cup of thick, white
sauce. Make six beetroot pâtés, fill them up with the preparation, and
garnish with tiny bits of parsley round the beetroot. The remains of
cold sweetbreads, or any kind of white meat, will do for this entrée.


CREAM OF CHICKEN.

Take the flesh from the breast of a chicken, place it in a mortar, and
pound for ten minutes. Have two slices of bread soaked in milk; press
the milk from it; pound it in the mortar with the chicken and the yolk
of two eggs; pepper and salt. Pass through a wire and hair sieve; add a
gill of switched cream; grease any kind of fancy shapes, and steam for
ten minutes; turn out, and garnish with dice-cut pieces of ham, white
of egg, and truffle. Dish on a border of mashed potatoes, and serve
with sauce suprême. Serve green peas in the centre of this entrée.


CREAM OF RABBIT.

Take the fillets of the back of two rabbits; scrape and pound in a
mortar with one ounce of butter, the yolks of two eggs; soak two slices
of bread in sweet milk, press the milk out and pound in the mortar;
pass through a wire and hair sieve. Switch a glass of cream and the
white of the two eggs, and add to the pounded rabbit. Steam in timbale
moulds, covered with white paper for fifteen minutes. Serve with a
cream sauce, and fill the centre with a few whole tomatoes, stewed in a
glass of water, with a half-ounce of butter; pepper and salt.


LARDED SWEETBREADS

are cooked in the same way as for frying--the first part. Keep the
sweetbreads whole, trim them neatly, and have twenty stripes of bacon
two inches long, and with a larding needle draw the bacon gently
through the sweetbreads, reversing the lines. Place in a stew-pan
with one ounce of butter, and brown the sweetbreads to a light-brown
colour; pour over half-pint of stock or water; simmer slowly for
twenty minutes. Take a spoonful of butter and flour, and add to the
sweetbreads a few chopped mushrooms; pepper and salt. Strain the sauce
over the sweetbreads, garnish with Brussels sprouts in the centre.


FILLET OF BEEF WITH FRIED POTATO CHIPS.

Take one pound and a-quarter of fillet steak, cut it into four round
slices, broil before a clear fire; have one ounce of fresh butter mixed
with a few leaves of chopped parsley; pepper and salt; form into round
balls, and place on the top of the broiled steak. Serve with fried
potato chips. Peel and slice four potatoes into a basin with salt and
water; dry on a clean towel, and fry in hot lard. Serve round the
fillets of beef.


ENTRÉE RABBIT À LA TARTE.

Take the fillets of two young rabbits, flatten them with a rolling-pin
dipped in cold water. Dip in beaten egg and bread-crumbs, and fry
a light-brown colour. Dish in a corner-dish, with a ring of mashed
potatoes. On the bottom of the dish serve with sauce à la tarte.

These entrées will be found most economical for housekeeping, when
served before dinner or for lunch with cold roast beef, garnished and
glazed in the way described for glazing hams or tongues.

All entrées should be dished with a ring of mashed potatoes, or a ring
on the bottom of the dish of rice, and dished in a circle, a garnish of
vegetables in the centre, and sauce round the base.




SAUCES OF ENTRÉES.


SAUCE AU SUPRÊME.

Take the bones of a fowl of which the flesh has been used for entrées;
break the bones in small pieces; boil them gently in a pint of water,
with one clove, one onion, and a piece of carrot and turnip, two
ounces of salt bacon. Boil for one hour, strain, and make the sauce as
follows:--Place in a sauce-pan one ounce of butter and one of flour;
brown over the fire to a light-brown colour; pour in the chicken stock;
boil till it adheres to the back of the spoon; add one spoonful of
tomato sauce, pepper and salt, and use where required. Add a glass of
sherry if wanted.


SALMIS SAUCES.

Take one cupful of game stock, made from trimmings of roast game, add
one ounce of browned flour and butter, one glass of port wine, and a
pinch of red pepper and salt.


RUSSIAN SAUCE.

Place a stew-pan on the fire, slice three onions, let them brown in one
ounce of butter, a pinch of pepper and salt; cover with a tight cover
till the onions are dissolved; add one ounce of flour, a cup of stock,
a glass of cream; stir over the fire for five minutes; pass through a
pointed strainer; keep hot in the banbery.

What is meant by a banbery for keeping sauces a young cook may not
know. I will explain. Procure a square-topped pan almost like a
roasting-pan, and fill it half-full of boiling water. Set the little
pans into it, to keep sauces hot when made, and to prevent them
burning. Set the sauces in with small bits of butter on the top, so as
not to let a skin form.


TO MAKE BROWN SAUCE.

Take four ounces of butter, place it in a sauce-pan with four ounces of
flour, and brown over the fire; then with a wooden spoon stir the sauce
gradually while pouring in a quart and a pint of second stock, made in
the way laid down for boiling stocks. Boil till it thickens and adheres
to the back of the spoon; add a few drops of Worcestershire sauce.
One-fourth of this sauce will do for a single entrée. Mushrooms can be
added.


TRUFFLE SAUCE.

Mince two truffles, and place in a stew-pan with a cupful of brown
sauce; boil for a quarter of an hour; add a glass of sherry.


TOMATO SAUCE.

Stew a few tomatoes in pepper and salt till tender, with the red part
of one carrot. Pass through a wire and hair sieve, with two ounces of
butter, into a stew-pan, one ounce of flour, and melt; add a cup and
a-half of water; stir the tomato into the sauce.


WHITE SAUCE.

Take one ounce of flour, one ounce of butter, and melt it over the
fire, then add a tea-cupful of strong white stock made in the way
given for making white stock, one tea-cupful of milk, and a glass of
cream. To this sauce may be added a squeeze of lemon, chopped parsley,
mushrooms, or truffles.


VEGETABLE SAUCE.

Take some young carrots, and turnips, and onions, cut in thin stripes
an inch long; one slice of bacon, cut in thin stripes the same as the
vegetables, and the white of an egg boiled hard. Have the bacon and
vegetables cooked in water, strain and add to a pint of brown sauce.
This sauce will do for mutton cutlets.


SAUCE PIQUANTE.

Put two tea-spoonfuls of chopped onions, with one of common vinegar,
and one glass of stock; let the onion boil a few minutes; add a cupful
of brown sauce (this sauce must be as thick as cream); one tea-spoonful
of French mustard, a few chopped gherkins and mushrooms.




TO HAVE STOCK FOR SAUCES OR PLAIN ENTRÉES ALWAYS AT HAND.


Take the bones of roast joints, and the trimmings of cutlets, put them
in a sauce-pan with carrot, turnip, celery, and pepper-corns tied in a
piece of muslin; boil them slowly from four to five hours, then strain
into a basin till required for use.

Game stock can be made in the same way, any bones of roast game should
be kept by themselves, but you can take a portion of another stock to
help the game stock for sauces.

White stock is made with a knuckle of veal, or the bones of rabbit or
fowl, or any uncooked meat, with carrots, turnips, a bay leaf, a sprig
of thyme, two or three blades of parsley tied in a bunch; let it simmer
beside the fire for six hours, then pass it through a sieve; never let
the stock remain more than one day in warm weather in the same basin.
Pour it into a sauce-pan, and bring it to the boil each day; it will
sour if this is not done. A few basins should be kept for stocks, and
used for nothing else. The stock basins should be scalded and kept as
clean as dairy dishes. All cooks should be most careful to have these
stocks of different kinds, as pouring water on roasts, or joints, or
game, is not satisfactory; sauces are not good made of water. With care
there are always bones to be had for that purpose. All bones must be
cut very small.




JOINTS IN GENERAL.


How to divide a sheep is most useful to every one to know, and the
different names of the cuts of the sheep. Split a sheep straight down
the back; cut off the legs, and hang up in the larder. There is the
chump, that will roast or boil; then the loin chops. Cut off the flap
and roll it up, and make a force-meat stuffing, and have it braised.
The loin chops are best for broiling. Then raise the shoulder, and
there will be nine cutlets under the shoulder. Those are best for
dressed cutlets. Choose the mutton that is white in the colour, and
not too heavy, as when it is too fat there is great waste. Yet not too
lean, because it is a sign of poor mutton. All meat is tender if it
be kept for a few days before using. It is the most economical way to
get half a sheep from the butcher at once, if there is a large family,
because it is got so much cheaper.


TO ROAST A LEG OF MUTTON.

To every pound of mutton allow fifteen minutes to roast. The oven must
not be too hot when it first goes in, else it will burn on the outside,
and not cook in the heart. Dish on a hot dish. It is an improvement
to shake a little salt on the outside before pouring gravy over. To
make the gravy: pour all the grease off, and add a little stock to the
dripping pan, and pour over the roast.


BOILED LEG OF MUTTON.

Place a trimmed leg of mutton in a pot with plenty of water to cover,
and set it to boil. After skimming, add a handful of salt, two carrots
and turnips, one parsnip; and when the leg has boiled two hours and
a-half, it is done. Make a paper frill for the shank, and garnish with
vegetables.


SERPENT OF MUTTON.

Take a large neck of mutton; take away all the bones, and flatten
with a rolling-pin wet in cold water; make a stuffing of five ounces
of bread-crumbs, one ounce of suet, one egg, pepper and salt, a few
leaves of chopped parsley. Lay the meat out flat, place the force-meat
stuffing in the centre, and roll it up in the form of the letter S;
set it in a sauce-pan with one ounce of dripping, and brown. Dredge
the mutton with flour; put one quart of cold water on it, six drops
of Worcestershire sauce, a bay leaf, cut carrots and turnips, with a
vegetable cutting in fancy shapes, and boil in hot water in a separate
sauce-pan. When done, garnish round the serpent of mutton.


STEW OF RUMP BEEF.

Rump beef is the best part for stewing or braising. It should be of
a fine quality, a deep red colour, rich grained, and covered with
fat. When done, garnish it with some vegetables cut out with a round
vegetable-cutter the size of marbles, and braise the same as braised
leg of mutton.


ROAST CHICKEN.

Singe, and truss a chicken by cutting the legs off at the first joint.
Make an incision in the wings, and put the gizzard under the left
wing, and the liver under the right. Make a stuffing of three ounces
of bread-crumbs, two ounces of suet, a few leaves of chopped parsley,
pepper and salt, and one egg. Draw up the legs under the wings, and
stuff the chicken in the breast. Grease a buttered paper, and lay over
the baste frequently. Serve bread sauce in a boat. Time to cook, one
hour.


ROAST BEEF.

The English cut is the best for roasting. Choose one with a nice
under cut, and it is an economical way to take out the under cut and
hang it up in a cold larder till required for use, as it will make
very good steaks or entrées. Roast the beef in a moderately hot oven,
allowing fifteen minutes to the pound. If preferred, roast beef should
be under-done. Make a Yorkshire pudding in the following manner:--Put
three table-spoonfuls of flour into a basin, mix into a smooth batter
with milk, and add a pinch of salt, switch the yolk and whites of two
eggs separately to a stiff froth; pour into the batter. Bake under the
beef in a greased tin, when the beef is done. Dish a few minutes before
wanted, and sprinkle a little salt on the top of the beef. Pour the
grease off the pan, and put a tea-cupful of stock over the beef. Dish
the Yorkshire pudding round the beef, with horse-radish sauce or in a
separate dish.


BRAISED LEG OF MUTTON.

Put a small leg of mutton on the fire in a flat sauce-pan, with
plenty of room, and brown it slowly on both sides; then add one quart
of cold water, and let it simmer, one spoonful of browning, one of
Worcestershire sauce. Boil three ounces of macaroni in cold water, and
garnish round the mutton when about to serve.


TO BOIL A ROUND OF BEEF.

Put on a large pot with plenty of cold water, tie the meat up in a
nice round shape, and secure it tightly with skewers. It must never be
allowed to boil too fast, as that spoils salt meat. Garnish round the
base with nice-shaped carrots, and a cup of its liquor coloured with
browning over a few Brussels sprouts in four bunches round the dish.
Boil the beef fifteen minutes to the pound.


ROAST LOIN OF VEAL.

Take six pounds of the loin of veal; make an incision in the flap, and
place some veal stuffing in it; wrap it round the kidney fat so as to
secure it tightly. Envelop the loin in well-greased sheets of paper.
Roast before a moderate fire for two hours. Baste it very often. Dish
and pour some good brown gravy over it. Garnish with some nice fried
potatoes.


LOIN OF VEAL BRAISED.

Bone about four pounds of a loin, by taking away all the bones, and
flatten it out with a mallet wet in cold water. Make a veal stuffing
of six ounces of bread-crumbs, three ounces of suet, one egg, and a
few sweet herbs; lay this mixture into the centre of the veal, fold
it over in a roll, and tie it tightly. Put on a sauce-pan with three
slices of bacon, sliced carrot and turnip, and half an onion. Lay the
roll of veal on the top of the vegetables till browned. Cover with a
tight cover, and let it braise gently on a slow fire. About a cupful of
hot water may be added when the veal is browned. When cooked, dish it
up, and reduce the gravy it has been stewed in to a half cup. Time for
cooking, two hours. Garnish with tomatoes or glazed onions.


BOILED HAM.

Soak a ham in cold water, and, before putting it on to boil, scrape
all the grit and dirt off it. Boil from four to five hours, according
to size. When the skin easily peels off, it is done. Plunge it in cold
water, and remove the skin; make a glaze, and garnish in the following
manner:--Put one half-ounce of gelatine to soak in as much water as
will soak it to the thickness of cream. When it is melted, colour with
a few drops of browning, and glaze the ham. Make an icing with two
tea-spoonfuls of corn-flour, and one ounce fresh butter. Ornament with
a paper coronet. Garnish with bunches of parsley and paper frill. This
glaze will do for all kinds of meat requiring to be glazed.


BOILED LEG OF PORK.

Put a leg of pork on to boil. When it has boiled one hour, have two
carrots, half a turnip, and one parsnip tied in a cotton cloth, and
boil with pork for garnishing. Have half-a-pint of split pease soaked
over night. Tie the pease up loosely in a napkin, and boil in the same
pot with the pork. A leg of pork weighing eight pounds will take two
hours and a-half. Dish, and garnish with the vegetables. Serve the
pease pudding in a separate dish.


ROAST LEG OF PORK.

Make an incision between the skin and flesh; fill it with a stuffing of
bread-crumbs, one egg, flavoured with onion and sage; sew the crevice
with twine. Score the pork by cutting the rhind with a sharp knife in
strips, an inch apart. Roast for three hours; keep well basted. Serve
with apple sauce in a boat, and brown gravy.


PILLAU AU RIZ.

Boil a tea-cupful of rice in cold water for ten minutes, then take a
roast chicken from a previous day’s dinner; set it into a stew-pan
with the rice over, and one ounce of butter, half of an onion, a
piece of mace, pepper and salt, and a cup of stock. Simmer slowly for
three-quarters of an hour. Dish with the rice all over the chicken.


BOILED CHICKEN.

Truss a chicken by cutting the legs off at the second joint. Stick the
legs into the body, make a parsley sauce, and pour over the chicken.
Time to cook, one hour. Serve with streaky boiled bacon in a separate
dish. Garnish with a few nice-shaped vegetables.


ROAST GROUSE.

This bird must be roasted with great care, before a clear fire, for
twenty minutes. Some persons like all things well done, but the proper
way is to be under-done. Baste well, and dish on a buttered toast.
Serve with potato chips, bread sauce, and bread-crumbs.


ROAST HARE.

Hare should be kept for a week before roasting. Soak and wash in cold
water, and dry on a clean towel. Make a stuffing of bread-crumbs,
chopped parsley, one ounce of beef suet, part of the liver boiled and
finely chopped, pepper and salt, one egg and a little ketchup. Stuff
the hare; truss by placing the hind and fore legs flat against the
sides; set the head back to rest on the shoulders; stick a trussing
needle through the head of the hare, to keep back the head; baste with
butter and sweet milk. Cook for two hours; serve with a gravy and red
currant jelly.


ROAST RABBIT

Is cooked in the same manner as roast hare.


TO BOIL RABBITS WHOLE.

taken from; chop fine with a little parsley, a small onion, pepper, and
salt. Soak two slices of bread in sweet milk; press out the milk; and

for fifteen minutes a light-brown colour. Serve with a brown sauce with
capers in it.


BEEFSTEAK PIE.

One pound of the best beefsteak beaten and sprinkled with pepper and

rolls, with a little chopped onions. Place at the bottom of the dish
two sheep’s kidneys, cut in slices, and two hard-boiled eggs laid
through the pie, and cover with puff paste. A few drops of sauce and
two glasses of stock may be added to the pie.


ROAST PARTRIDGES.

Pick and draw and clean these birds the same as fowls. Do not cut off
the heads; twist the neck round the wing; bring the head to the breast.
The legs and wings may be trussed the same as a fowl’s. The feet are
left on and crossed one over the other. Baste well with butter before a
clear fire. A partridge will take from twenty minutes to half-an-hour,
and a pheasant three-quarters of an hour. Serve on toasted bread, with
gravy and bread sauce.

Blackcock should be served in the same way.


RABBIT PIE.

ICE CREAM.

Take a quart of cream and flavour with any kind of flavouring, such as

three eggs and two cups of milk. Steam for two hours and a-half. Wash
and clean the fruit on a clean towel, and dry in the oven. Chop the
lemon-peel and mix with the fruit; and all the spice with the flour.
Lastly, stir in the milk, and switch the yolks and whites of egg stiff.
Steam in a greased mould or cloth that has been rung out of hot water,
greased and buttered. Lay a plate at the bottom to prevent the pudding

and then in bread-crumbs, and fry in hot lard. Dish in a pyramid on a
folded napkin, and sprinkle sifted sugar over it. Serve hot.


LEMON PUDDING.

Line an ashet with puff paste, place four ounces of butter, the yolks
of four eggs, the juice of one lemon, three tea-spoonfuls of corn-flour
wet with cold water, two ounces of sugar. Mix all together, and stir in
a jug over hot water on the fire till it assumes the appearance of a
custard. Bake the crust and pour the lemon mixture into it, switch the
whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, with two ounces of sifted sugar,
and place on top of pudding. Place for a minute in the oven, and serve
hot.


VANILLA CREAM.

Soak half a sixpenny packet of gelatine in half a tea-cupful of milk,
for half-an-hour; set it into a pan of warm water till it melts, then

all together in a copper pan over the fire till it boils. Draw to the
side to simmer gently for fifteen minutes. The pan must not be shaken;
pour through a jelly bag. Rinse out a mould with cold water before
pouring in the jelly. One or two glasses of wine may be added.


ŒUF À LA NEIGE.

Place in a sauce-pan one pint of milk and bring to the boil; have three
yolks of eggs beaten with three tea-spoonfuls of corn-flour and two
table-spoonfuls of cold milk; blend all together with back of wooden
spoon; give it one boil, and flavour with essence of almond. When cold,
turn into a glass dish, switch the whites of eggs to a stiff froth, add
an ounce of sugar, and garnish the top by dropping it in spoonfuls on
the top. Part may be coloured with cochineal, place some tiny pieces of
red currant jelly on the top of each piece.

Soak four penny sponge cakes in a glass of sherry for half-an-hour; cut
each sponge cake into four pieces, lay the four pieces at the bottom
of a glass dish; spread a layer of strawberry jam; then have a thin
custard made with two eggs and two tea-spoonfuls of corn-flour and a
breakfast-cupful of milk. Let it get cold, and pour over the sponge
cake and jam. Sprinkle with chopped almonds and dried cherries. Lay

pint basin, and set it with dried cherries; steam for one hour slowly.
Make a sauce in the following way:--Place one ounce of sugar in a pan,
brown it to the colour of treacle, and pour over two glasses of water;
boil for ten minutes. Serve round pudding.




PUDDING SAUCES.


BRANDY SAUCE.

Take half-an-ounce of butter, half-an-ounce of flour, one ounce of
sugar; melt together; add a tea-cupful of boiling water gradually,
keeping beating all the time. When it boils, add a glass of brandy; it
must not boil afterwards, as liquors lose strength in boiling.


WINE SAUCE.

Take two table-spoonfuls of corn-flour, three ounces of sugar, an ounce
of butter, and a pint of water; stir over the fire till it boils; add
a glass of wine and a grated nutmeg. The juice of fresh fruit, such as
strawberry, raspberry, peaches, or the juice from preserved fruit, when
fresh fruit cannot be procured, may be used instead of wine.


GERMAN SAUCE.

Set a stew-pan on the fire with a pint of boiling water; set a smaller
one in it, and break in the yolks of two eggs, one ounce of sugar, a
glass of sherry, juice of half a lemon, half-an-ounce of butter, and a
pinch of salt. This sauce must be kept switched over a moderate heat
till it assumes the appearance of a switched cream. Pour over steamed
puddings.


CUSTARD SAUCE.

Place one pint of milk on the fire till it gets hot, on the point of
boiling. Then take the yolks of two eggs, mix smooth with a little cold
milk, and two tea-spoonfuls of corn-flour, and stir into the boiling
milk. A little cream is an improvement to this sauce, and a few drops
of vanilla.




SAVOURY DISHES.


CURRIED EGGS.

Boil four eggs hard, plunge them into cold water, skin and cut them
in slices; place a half-ounce of butter in a sauce-pan, and one
tea-spoonful of curry; stir the butter and curry over the fire, and
slice one onion. Fry a light-brown. Stir in gently a half-pint of
gravy, and stew slowly. Add one tea-spoonful of corn-flour, mixed with
half-a-cup of cream. Boil a few minutes, and pour over the eggs. Serve
hot.


SAVOURY OMELET.

Switch three eggs for five minutes, yolk and white separate; then
have a little chopped parsley, a tiny piece of onion which has been
previously boiled, pepper and salt, with the eggs. Have an omelet-pan
hot with quarter of an ounce of fresh butter; fry lightly on one side,
hold before the fire or place in a hot oven for a few minutes. Fold
over and serve.


POACHED EGGS.

Have a flat sauce-pan with one quart of water boiling; put in a
tea-spoonful of salt, and four drops of vinegar. Break the eggs into a
cup, one by one; drop them into the pan with a table-spoon. See that
the water is poured over the eggs. When the white is set over the egg
it is ready. Have a round slice of toast buttered; place the eggs on it.


EGGS À LA MAÎTRE D’HOTÊL.

Boil six eggs hard, and cut them in halves. Dish them in a circle.
Pour over them a sauce made as follows:--Place one ounce of butter in
a sauce-pan, with half-an-ounce of flour, one tea-cupful of milk. Stir
gradually till it thickens. Add a little cream and white pepper, and a
squeeze of a lemon.


KIDNEY OMELET.

Mince fine two sheep kidneys; place in a stew-pan, with a small piece
of butter, pepper and salt, a few chopped parsley leaves, a few drops
of Worcestershire sauce and a glass of stock. Stew gently for twenty
minutes. Prepare the omelet as follows:--Separate the yolk and whites
of four eggs, switch the whites to a stiff froth, place the whites and
yolks together, pepper and salt. Have the omelet-pan hot, with a little
fresh butter; pour in the eggs; cook for three minutes gently, not
too fast. Hold the pan before the fire to brown; then lay the stewed
kidneys in the centre.


HAM OMELET

Is prepared in the same way as kidney omelet. Any kind of fine minced
meat, minced chickens, and ham can be used in the same way for
breakfasts.


STUFFED EGGS.

Take four eggs and cut them in halves, length ways; take out the
yolks and rub them to a paste; add one spoonful of cream, a few
leaves of parsley chopped fine, pepper and salt, and a half-ounce of
bread-crumbs; place this mixture in the centre of the egg, in the shape
of the yolk of egg. Take another and switch it, and egg and bread-crumb
the savoury eggs on the outside. Fry in hot butter, and serve with
fried parsley garnish.


KIDNEYS AND TOAST.

Mince fine four kidneys, place them in a sauce-pan with a glass of
stock, a few drops of Harvey or Worcestershire sauce, pepper and salt,
and a little chopped parsley; stew slowly. Have six round pieces of
toast buttered; build the mince on it. Have the yolk of a hard-boiled
egg in a pointed strainer, a pinch of pepper and salt, and rub it
through the point of a strainer on the top of the toast for a garnish.
A few leaves of parsley may be laid round for a garnish.


CHEESE BISCUITS.

Take half-a-pound of flour, half a pound of butter, half a pound of
cheese; rub these three one way into crumbs, with a pinch of cayenne
pepper. Wet a little, and knead to a stiff dough. Bake on buttered
paper in a hot oven.


LOBSTER CROQUETS.

Take the flesh of the lobster, take all the meat out of the shell, and
chop in small pieces; place half an ounce of butter in a sauce-pan,
half-ounce flour, and half a tea-cupful of milk; stir over the fire
till it thickens, then add the flesh of the lobster, the yolks of two
eggs, and a pinch of cayenne; turn the croquet out on a plate to cool;
form the mixture into round balls; dip in egg and bread-crumbs, and fry
a light-brown colour.


CAULIFLOWER À GRATIN.

Take a nice head of cauliflower, boil for fifteen minutes, place in a
dish that will stand the fire, and pour over it a white sauce made of
one spoonful of flour moistened in cold milk, and stirred into a cupful
of boiling milk, pepper and salt. Pour over the cauliflower. Grate
three ounces of cheese. On the top place little pieces of butter, and
cook a light-brown colour.


CHEESE SOUFFLÉE.

Take nine table-spoonfuls of flour, stir in gently a pint of milk
to make the batter as thick as cream; strain it through a pointed
strainer, to prevent being lumpy. Have four ounces of grated cheese,
a pinch of cayenne pepper, and salt. Switch the yolks and whites of
three eggs separate for five minutes. Stir in the last thing, into the
batter; bake in a round buttered dish, in a hot oven, half-an-hour
before required, as soufflées do not do well to be baked too soon.




VEGETABLES.


POTATO CHIPS.

To make potato chips, get some nice round potatoes, and slice them into
thin slices in a basin, with salt and water, for one hour; then dry on
a clean towel, and fry in hot lard a light-brown colour.


BRUSSELS SPROUTS.

Put on to boil in boiling water, with a pinch of salt and soda, and
boil for twenty minutes; dish, and dry on a clean towel. Return to
the sauce-pan, and put half-an-ounce of butter, and shake them while
heating to prevent them burning.


GREEN PEASE.

Green peas should be put on to boil in boiling water and salt. The time
for boiling depends on the age; strain, and place a piece of butter,
pepper and salt, with a few leaves of mint.


ASPARAGUS WITH WHITE SAUCE.

Tie into a bundle the asparagus, after washing the stalks clean. Keep
all the heads the one way, put the asparagus on to cook in boiling
water, and salt; boil for twenty minutes. Dish them on square pieces of
buttered toast; pour a white sauce over.


VEGETABLE MARROW.

Cut the vegetable marrow into eight pieces, boil in some white stock
until tender. Make a little sauce with a pat of butter, a little juice
of lemon, and a grating of nutmeg. Pour over the vegetable marrow, and
serve.


TO BOIL POTATOES.

Great care should be taken in boiling potatoes. This is a vegetable
that is often neglected. When the potatoes boil, see that they do not
boil too fast. A handful of salt should be put into the water. Try with
a fork to see if ready. They must not boil too soft. Drain and shake
over the fire, and place a napkin over them and steam. Boil a small bit
of mint with them, when new.




CAKES, AND ICINGS FOR CAKES.


POUND CAKES.

Take one pound of butter, one pound of sugar, eight eggs, a few drops
of lemon. Place the butter in a basin, and warm it in cold weather
before the fire. Then beat with the hand. Have the eight eggs broken in
a basin, and drop one at a time till the eight are added. Have a tin
hoop lined with buttered paper; add one pound of sifted flour. Currants
or raisins or lemon-peel can be added. Bake for one hour and a-quarter,
in not too hot an oven.


CREAM CAKE.

Take three ounces of butter, three ounces of sugar, one egg, three
glasses of milk, and a tea-spoonful of cinnamon; rub the butter and
sugar to a cream, then add the egg and milk. Put two tea-spoonfuls
of baking-powder with half-a-pound of flour, and knead it to a stiff
dough. If this quantity of flour seems too soft, take a little more,
as there is great difference in the strength of flour, and some flour
takes more moisture in baking. Cooks must therefore be guided by its
appearance. Roll the dough into a round cake; half cut through the
centre with a smaller cutter. Bake for twenty minutes. When cooked,
fill the centre with switched cream, and ice the top of it the same as
ordinary cakes.


SPONGE CAKE.

Break three eggs into a copper pan; take the weight of three eggs of
sifted sugar, and switch over a warm place, such as a pan of hot water,
or over the fire, till the eggs are warmed. Then remove from the heat,
and switch till cold, and the eggs assume the appearance of a thick
cream. Then mix in very lightly the weight of three eggs of flour,
flavour with vanilla, or almonds, or lemon, and bake in small sponge
cake tins for ten minutes in a hot oven.


ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR CAKE.

Take one cup of butter, two cups of sugar, three eggs, and four cups
of flour. Rub the butter and sugar to a cream; add the three eggs, one
at a time; one cup of milk; mix two tea-spoonfuls of baking-powder
with the flour, and stir into butter and sugar. Bake for one hour in a
moderate oven.


GOLD CAKE.

Separate the yolks and whites of six eggs. For the gold cake, take
the yolks of six eggs and beat to a cream, with six ounces of butter,
six ounces of sugar, the juice of half a lemon, and a tea-cupful of
milk. Mix butter, sugar, yolk of eggs, lemon, and milk all together,
with three-quarters of a pound of flour and two tea-spoonfuls of
baking-powder. Mix with flour, and add to the creamed sugar and butter.


SILVER CAKE.

This cake is made the same as the above, the only difference being to
switch the whites to a stiff froth. Use the same proportions. Butter
two tins or one large one, and lay the cake in alternated, so that when
it is cut it will be nicely mixed, one yellow and one white. Serve cut
in a cake basket.


CHEESE CAKES.

Place a pint of milk on the fire to get hot, and make a curd by putting
a few drops of rennet in it; press the whey from the curd, mix three
eggs with the curd, three ratafia biscuits, a glass of cream, two
ounces of sugar, and a few drops of lemon. Press the curd in a napkin
to absorb the moisture. Pound the above mixture in a mortar. Line
half-a-dozen tartlet pans with puff paste, fill the tartlet pans with
the cheese custard, and place a couple of stripes of candied peel on
the top of each.


GINGER BREAD.

Mix half-a-pound of butter, and half-a-pound of soft sugar,
half-a-pound of treacle, with a wooden spoon, five eggs, yolks and
whites switched separately; a tea-cupful of sour milk, one tea-spoonful
of baking soda, one ounce of ginger, one pound and a-half of flour, a
drop of browning to make it dark, and two ounces of candied peel. Bake
in not too hot an oven.


LEMON CAKES.

Take four ounces of butter, four ounces of sugar, the juice of a lemon,
and half the rhind; rub on to the sugar the yolk of two eggs, one glass
of warm milk; knead stiff dough, and roll out, and cut with fancy
cutter any shape preferred.


JOHNNIE CAKE.

Take two cups of India meal, one cup of flour, mix three tea-spoonfuls
of baking-powder, three spoonfuls of sugar, a half-cup of melted
butter, two eggs. Add milk enough to make this a thick batter, and bake
for half-an-hour in a square flat pan; cut in square pieces; it is a
very nice cake for lunch.


GERMAN TEA CAKE.

Take three ounces of butter, three ounces of sugar, rubbed to a cream,
one egg, yolk and white switched; add to the butter and sugar twelve
ounces of flour, mix with the flour half-a-pound of currants, three
tea-spoonfuls of baking-powder, and a tea-spoonful of cinnamon, one
ounce lemon-peel, add one cup of milk to the butter and sugar; mix
the flour, currants, cinnamon, and peel, all together, and bake for
three-quarters of an hour in a hot oven. If the cakes are burning, lay
a paper over to prevent this. Bake till nothing sticks to the straw
when pierced.


QUAKER’S CAKES.

Take half-a-pound of sifted sugar, the yolks and whites of seven eggs
beaten separately, the juice of one lemon, and a half-pound of almonds
beaten fine with rose water. Beat the whites and yolks separately,
then mix them with the other ingredients, except the flour. Beat them
together half-an-hour, then shake in the flour, and put the cakes in
the oven.


DESSERT BISCUITS.

Rub one pound of butter, one pound of sugar, and five eggs to a cream;
add one tea-cupful of milk, a few drops of essence of lemon; knead to a
stiff dough; cut in rings, and leaves, and heart; when done, ornament
with icing sugar in the usual way.


LOAF CAKE.

Take the size of a walnut of German yeast dissolved in a pint of
warm milk, and a pinch of salt; stir as much flour in as will make a
thick sponge. Set it to raise till it gets light and throws up little
bubbles; then take two pounds of flour and make a hole in the centre,
and pour in the sponge. Add three-quarters of a pound of butter,
half-a-pound of soft sugar, four eggs, two ounces of lemon-peel,
three-quarters of a pound of currants, three-quarters of a pound of
raisins, and knead this all together, and set to raise for another
hour; then, when light, bake for one hour in a moderate oven.


DOUGH NUTS.

Take three ounces of butter, three ounces of soft sugar, rubbed to a
cream, one egg, a drop of vanilla, and one cup of milk, a pound and a
half of flour with three tea-spoonfuls of baking-powder. Knead into a
stiff dough, cut with a round cutter, cut a hole in the centre with a
smaller cutter, and fry in hot lard.


FRENCH WAFFLES.

Make a batter of nine table-spoonfuls of flour, in one pint of milk,
rubbed smoothly with the back of a wooden spoon; switch up three eggs,
and pour into the batter two ounces of melted butter, quarter of a
pound of sugar, one tea-spoonful of baking-powder; grease waffle irons,
and bake over a clear fire; sift over with white sugar, and serve hot.


ICES FOR CAKES.

Take half-a-pound of icing sugar to two whites of eggs; switch the
whites to a stiff froth, stiff enough to lift on a knife; then add the
sugar, and beat well up with the knife. Then pass through an icing-bag,
on whatever is to be iced; ornament any fancy shape that is desired.




THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PASTE.


PASTE NO. 1.--PUFF PASTE.

Wet four ounces of flour with cold water to a dough, as stiff as for a
breakfast roll; roll out and lay four ounces of fresh butter in pieces
on the paste; fold over and roll out four times, and set away to raise
in a cold place for three hours. Give the paste three turns more, and
it is ready for use. Care must be taken not to dust too much flour on;
rolling it at a cold slab or slate, with hands washed in cold water and
salt, is an improvement to this paste. A very hot oven is needed to
cook it. Do not allow the oven door to be opened, to let the draught
in, as this is bad for it.


PASTE NO. 2.--SHORT CRUST.

Take half-a-pound of butter, one pound of flour, one egg, and a glass
of milk, and two ounces of sugar; rub the butter and flour to crumbs,
then add the egg and a glass of milk; knead to a stiff dough, and bake
in a moderate oven; time, half-an-hour.


PASTE NO. 3.--PLAIN AMERICAN CRUST.

Take one pound of flour, two tea-spoonfuls of baking-powder, six ounces
of butter, rubbed to crumbs by rubbing it the one way; a pinch of salt
if for a meat dish, and for a sweet dish a spoonful of sugar. Make a
hole in the centre, and draw the flour all in, wet with cold water to
the stiffness of soda scones; bake in a moderate oven.


PASTE NO. 4.--HARD PASTE FOR RAISED PIES.

Put one pound of flour on to a slab, rub in three ounces of clarified
fat, and a pinch of salt; wet with hot water, not very soft, and knead
for half-an-hour to get it stiff. This paste will do for raised pies or
mutton pies.


PASTE NO. 5.--SUET CRUST.

Mince fine eight ounces of suet, and mix it into one pound of flour
and a pinch of salt. This paste must not be worked much, and is used
for steamed or boiled crust. Boiled crust requires to boil from twenty
minutes to two hours, depending on what size is boiling. This crust
could be baked as well as steamed.


A HINT ON THE HEAT OF THE OVEN.

For baking paste, hold your hand in the oven a quarter of a minute;
if the hand cannot be held any longer, it is hot enough; if the hand
cannot be held so long, it will be too hot. Place some white paper over
whatever is baking, and this will keep it from burning.
