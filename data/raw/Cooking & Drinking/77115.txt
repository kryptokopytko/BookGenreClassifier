PREFACE


The manufacture of ice cream is based on certain scientific principles.
It is the purpose of this laboratory manual to help the student to
better understand the application of these principles. This manual,
which is the result of several years’ experience in teaching, is
not intended as a textbook, but as a brief and concise outline of
laboratory exercises. It will also serve as a suitable place for the
student to record observations. The exercises have been prepared, so
that each instructor may make selections and combinations suitable for
the equipment and the needs of his course.

Because this is comparatively a new subject and the ideas regarding ice
cream production and manufacture are constantly changing, the authors
recognize that this manual will need frequent revisions. An effort will
be made to keep it thoroughly up to date.

An Ice Cream Laboratory Guide




LABORATORY EQUIPMENT


The exercises in this manual may be selected or easily modified, so
that they will be suitable for any laboratory equipment. For example,
the receipts have been prepared with the expectation that a 10-gallon
freezer would be used; if a smaller freezer is used, the receipts may
be reduced proportionally.

Much better instruction can be given if the equipment includes an
artificial refrigerating plant for freezing and hardening the ice
cream. If the equipment does not include an artificial refrigerating
plant, a tub and can freezer, using an ice and salt mixture for
freezing, and a wooden box for packing and hardening the ice cream, in
ice and salt, may be used. The hardening box should be made of 2 inch
matched lumber so that it will not leak. The size of the box will be
determined by the amount of ice cream manufactured. It should be built
in compartments which will hold six five gallon cans. This will require
a box 26 inches wide by 32 inches deep by 36 inches long, outside
measurement, with a hinged cover for each compartment.

If much ice cream is to be made an ice cream mixer is a necessity, but
if a small amount is made each batch may be mixed in a 40 quart milk
can. A homogenizer and emulsor may be included in the equipment.

With whatever type of freezer is used, there should be one or two
small hand freezers, to freeze small batches and to try new receipts.
An ice crusher should be included for crushing ice.

The equipment should include the necessary small utensils, such as
pails, dippers, ladles, spoons, thermometers, scales, measures, pack
cans, etc.

There should be a suitable sink connected with hot and cold water and
steam, for washing and scalding the utensils. A suitable rack should be
provided for drying and holding the utensils and pack cans. Because of
the salt used, care must be exercised, as it is liable to get on the
utensils and cause them to rust.

All belts and gears on machines should be protected, so that persons
cannot be caught and injured in them.

EXERCISE I REPORT


STANDARDIZATION

One of the main requirements for a successful ice cream business is
uniformity of quality. In order to obtain this, it is necessary to
have cream each time containing the same percentage of fat. As it is
impossible to always get cream of a uniform fat content, the cream
must be standardized. That is, the percentage of fat must be either
increased or decreased to the desired amount. It is the usual practice
to have richer cream than is to be used and reduce it by the addition
of less rich cream, whole milk, or skim milk. If the cream was lower in
percentage of fat than was desired, it could be standardized only by
the addition of richer cream.

Prof. R. A. Pearson has devised a very simple method, known as the
rectangular method of standardization. This method is as follows: draw
a rectangle and place in the center the percentage of fat desired. At
the left hand corners place the percentages of fat in the materials to
be mixed. It is customary to place the larger figure at the top, thus:

[Illustration]

Then subtract diagonally, placing the remainders at the right hand
corners, as shown above. These show the proportions by weight in which
the materials must be mixed to give the desired percentage of fat.

A problem may serve to illustrate the method.

How many pounds each of 30% cream and 4% milk are necessary to make 260
lbs. of 20% cream?

[Illustration]

This shows 16 lbs. 30% cream and 10 lbs. 4% milk make 26 lbs. of
20% cream, but 260 lbs. is required. This is best solved by simple
proportion:

10 lbs. milk∶ 26 lbs. 20% cream∷ x lbs. milk∶ 260 lbs. 20% cream.

Solving x = 100 lbs. 4% milk required and 260-100 lbs. milk = 160 lbs.
30% cream required which may also be determined by proportion.

To be sure no mistakes are made in figuring, it is best to prove all
standardizations. The proof is simple.

    260 lbs. 20% cream contains 52 lbs. fat (required).
    160 lbs. 30%   ”      ”     48 lbs.  ”
    100 lbs.  4% milk     ”      4 lbs.  ”
                                —
              Making a total of 52 lbs. fat, the amount required.

In the above problem a definite amount of the mixture was required.
There is another class of standardization problems in which the amount
of one of the materials is given, to find the quantity of the other
required to standardize it:

How much 4% milk must be mixed with 420 lbs. of 40% cream to make a
mixture testing 25% fat?

[Illustration]

This shows that 15 lbs. of 4% milk will standardize 21 lbs. of 40%
cream to a cream tasting 25% fat. But there are 420 lbs. of 40% cream
to standardize. By simple proportion,

15 lbs. 4% milk∶ 21 lbs. 40% cream∷ x lbs. 4% milk∶ 420 lbs. 40% cream.

Solving x = 300 lbs. 4% milk

420 lbs. cream + 300 lbs. milk = 720 lbs. 25% cream.

Proof:

    720 lbs. of 25% cream contains 180 lbs. fat.
    300 lbs. of  4% milk     ”      12 lbs.  ”
    420 lbs. of 40% cream    ”     168 lbs.  ”
                                   ———
                 Making a total of 180 lbs. fat.




EXERCISE NUMBER II

STANDARDIZATION


Cream and milk to standardize will be furnished.

Test both by the Babcock method and report the result to the
instructor, who will assign a definite percentage of fat for the
standardized mixture.

After standardizing, test a sample of the standardized mixture by the
Babcock method to test the accuracy of your work.

Report all calculations and results on opposite page.

EXERCISE II REPORT




EXERCISE NUMBER III

TESTING ICE CREAM FOR FAT


Ice cream cannot be tested for fat, by the Babcock test, as milk,
because the acid chars the sugar, which interferes with the reading.
Various methods of testing ice cream, so as to overcome this
disadvantage have been devised. A few of the simpler ones follow.

Test a sample of ice cream by each of the following methods and report
results on the opposite page.

Method of Prof. H. E. Ross: Mix equal parts by weight of melted ice
cream and water. Weigh into a 9 gram 50% cream bottle 9 grams of the
mixture. Add 17.5 cc. of glacial acetic acid. Shake for two to three
minutes. Next add 15 cc. of sulphuric acid such as is used for the
Babcock test. Shake for one minute and proceed as in the ordinary
Babcock test. Multiply the reading by two.

Method of J. P. Dawson: Weigh 18 grams of melted ice cream at a
temperature of 70 degrees F. into a 30%, 9 inch cream test bottle. Add
8 cc. of glacial acetic acid, agitate gently for 2 minutes and add 10
cc. of Babcock sulphuric acid. Shake and centrifuge in the usual manner.

Note: There appears to be no reason why one half the quantities of ice
cream and acids may not be used in a 6 inch 9 gram 50% cream bottle.

Method often used by the authors: Weigh 9 grams of melted ice cream
into a 6 inch 50%, 9 gram cream bottle and add about 9 cc. of water.
Add three quarters of an acid measure of glacial acetic acid and mix
thoroughly. Next add two thirds of an acid measure of Babcock sulphuric
acid. Shake till well mixed and centrifuge in the usual manner.

EXERCISE III REPORT




EXERCISE NUMBER IV

EFFECT OF THE SALT AND ICE MIXTURE ON TEMPERATURE


Make a brine one part salt to ten parts of water by weight. With part
of this fill the can of a hand freezer two thirds full just as though
it were an ice cream mix which you were going to freeze. Record the
temperature of this brine.

_Trial_ 1. Using a mixture of one pound of salt to 10 lbs. of crushed
ice, try freezing the brine in the freezer can. Turn 10 minutes,
keeping the freezer can well covered with the ice and salt mixture.
Open and record the temperature of the brine in the can.

_Trial_ 2. Empty the freezer can and tub and refill the can with more
of the brine used in Trial 1. Be sure to have it the same temperature.
Using a salt and ice mixture of the same proportions, pack the tub
again and in addition add enough cold water so that it starts to
run from the overflow hole in the tub. Turn the freezer 10 minutes,
recording the temperature of the brine flowing from the overflow hole
every 2 minutes. Be sure to keep the ice-salt-water mixture in the tub
well mixed by punching with a stick such as a sawed-off broom handle.
Again record the temperature of the brine in the can. Why does it
differ from what it was in Trial 1?

_Trial_ 3. Repeat Trial 2, except use a mixture of salt and ice one to
six instead of one to 10. Record results.

_Trial_ 4. Repeat Trial 3 but do not mix the ice, salt, and water in
the tub. Explain the difference in the results obtained in Trials 3 and
4.

Tabulate and report all the data which you have recorded.

EXERCISE IV REPORT




CLASSIFICATION OF ICE CREAM


In the absence of the adoption of any uniform standard classification
of ice cream, the following classification in use by the authors is
given. It is simple, yet comprehensive, and is arranged according to
fundamental differences in composition. This seems to be the most
logical basis for classifying ice cream and is very satisfactory from
a laboratory standpoint. Exercises and representative formulas will be
given for each of these classes.

I. Plain or uncooked ice cream, often known as Philadelphia ice cream,
is made from cream, sugar, and flavoring, with or without condensed
milk or some stabilizer. It may be subdivided as follows:

    1. Plain—Flavors such as Vanilla, Chocolate, Caramel,
       Coffee, Mint, etc.

    2. Fruit—Flavored with fresh or canned fruits such as
       Peach, Pineapple, Strawberry, Cherry, etc.

    3. Nut—Flavored with such nuts as Walnut, Almond,
       Filbert, Chestnut, Pistachio, etc.

    4. Bisque—Flavored with Marshmallows, Macaroons,
       Sponge Cake, Nabisco Wafers, Grape-nuts, etc.

II. Cooked ice cream, often known as French or Neapolitan ice cream, is
made from cream, sugar, flavoring, and eggs. As custards they sometimes
contain flour or cornstarch. The following subdivisions are recognized:

    1. Parfaits or French—Flavors such as Vanilla,
       Chocolate, etc., are most common, but various
       fruits are sometimes used.

    2. Puddings—These are highly flavored with various
       dried and candied fruits, nuts, and spices.
       Examples are Nesselrode, Roman, and English Plum.

    3. Custards—These contain flour, cornstarch, tapioca,
       or other similar ingredients, and are almost always
       flavored with vanilla.

III. Sherbets and Ices are made from water or milk, sugar, often egg
albumen and a stabilizer, and flavored with fruit juices or other
natural flavoring. The most prominent classes are the following:

    1. Ices—Made from water, sugar and some natural
       flavoring without eggs or a stabilizer. This may
       include granites and frappés. Granites are frozen
       with little agitation, while frappés are only
       semi-frozen to a slushy consistency.

    2. Water Sherbets—are made the same as ices with the
       addition of egg whites and sometimes a stabilizer.
       If the whole egg is used, they are sometimes called
       souffles.

    3. Punches—are ices or water sherbets flavored with
       liquors or highly flavored with fruit juices and
       spices.

    4. Milk Sherbets—Made from skimmed or whole milk,
       sugar, and egg whites, with or without a stabilizer
       and flavored with some natural flavoring.

    5. Lacto—Made from skimmed or whole sour milk instead
       of sweet milk but in other respects they resemble
       milk sherbets.

IV. Mousse is a rich cream, sweetened and whipped to a stiff froth,
flavored and frozen in moulds or cans.

In the laboratories at the New York state agricultural college 20%
cream is used in making all plain or uncooked ice creams. Therefore
in the following exercises and formulas a 20% cream is used as a base
in most cases. This, however, may be reduced to 18% or 16% if it is
thought desirable.

It must be remembered that the formulas given are for laboratory use
and are not especially recommended as ideal formulas for commercial
use. Many of them have given good results in commercial plants but
there are so many variations and combinations possible that no single
formula or group of formulas can be given as ideal for all commercial
plants.

If the use of condensed milk is desired eight pounds of whole condensed
milk may be substituted for the same amount of cream with excellent
results in any of the formulas given for plain ice cream. Most
commercial plants use condensed milk to give the ice cream more body
and better standing quality.




THE USE OF STABILIZERS


A stabilizer of some kind is generally admitted to be necessary in
commercial ice cream. The three most commonly used are gelatin, ice
cream powders and gum tragacanth.

Gelatin may be prepared in any of the three following ways, using
either milk or water for dissolving it. However, if milk is used, one
of the first two methods should be used, so as to avoid any cooked
flavor from boiled milk.

1. Using one pint to one quart of water or milk to each two ounces of
gelatin, soak the gelatin in the cold liquid for fifteen to thirty
minutes. Then heat the mixture up to a temperature of 160 degrees to
170 degrees F. and add to the cream with rapid agitation.

2. The same as number one, except heat the mixture only to a
temperature of 125 degrees to 130 degrees F. for a sufficient time to
thoroughly dissolve all of the gelatin.

3. Heat the necessary amount of water to boiling, dump the gelatin into
it and stir till dissolved. Then add to the cream with rapid stirring.

Ice cream powders should be used according to the directions given with
them.

Gum tragacanth stock is made in the following manner. Place the dry gum
in cold water, using one ounce of gum to four pounds of water. Heat
slowly and uniformly over a low flame or better in a double boiler
to a temperature of about 110 degrees F. Hold at this temperature
for several hours or until the dry gum has absorbed all the water it
will hold. It does not go into true solution in water but will absorb
about fifty times its own weight of the water. Strain through a coarse
strainer and cool. It is then ready for immediate use. Sometimes enough
is made at one time to last for several days, in which case it is best
to add sufficient sugar to keep it from spoiling.




EXERCISE NUMBER V

FREEZING PLAIN ICE CREAM


Freeze ice creams after the following formulas, which may be reduced to
suit the capacity of the freezer used. Eight pounds of whole condensed
milk may be substituted for eight pounds of the cream if desired. Fill
out the record blank on opposite page.

No. 1.

    40 pounds of 20% cream

METHODS OF MEASURING SWELL


Freeze one or more batches of plain ice cream as assigned and measure
the per cent. of swell in each of the following ways. Record results on
the opposite page.

_Receipt:_

    40 pounds of 20% cream
     8 pounds of sugar
     4 ounces of vanilla extract
     4 ounces of gelatin if desired (See page 21)

1. Measure the gallons of mix used. Then measure in packing cans the
gallons of ice cream obtained and calculate the per cent. of swell.

2. Weigh one gallon of the mix. Weigh the first gallon and the last
gallon of ice cream removed from the freezer and calculate the per
cent. of swell in each case.

3. Take two samples, preferably from different packing cans of ice
cream from the same freezer, and determine the per cent. of swell by
the method given in Bulletin 241 of the Wisconsin Station as follows:
Take a 50 cc. sample of ice cream with the sampler furnished you and
transfer to a 300 cc. beaker, using exactly 200 cc. of hot water to
melt it. Then transfer all of this to a 250 cc. Florence flask and add
1 or 2 cc. of ether (measured) to reduce the foam. Next add enough
water measured from a burette to fill the flask to the mark. The ether
and water required represent the swell. Calculate the per cent. in each
case.

Which method do you consider the most accurate for commercial use and
why? For experimental use and why? Give special advantages of each
test.

HARDENING ICE CREAM

Ice cream may be of the highest quality when removed from the freezer
and yet be ruined before it becomes hard enough to ship unless the
hardening is properly accomplished. The two principal methods in use
are the salt and ice method and the artificially cooled dry hardening
room where the cans of ice cream are simply set in a very cold room
and hardened by still or circulating cold air. The temperature of
such a room should be maintained at near zero F. With either method
the hardening process should not require more than twelve hours. The
packing cans should always be cold before they are filled with ice
cream, so as to prevent melting in the bottom.

_Directions for hardening in salt and ice._ Either ordinary packing
tubs or a large box may be used for this purpose. If tubs are used,
simply pack well with salt and ice mixed in the proportion of one to
eight. It is necessary to repack these tubs two or three times a day in
order to keep the ice cream hard. When several cans of ice cream are
to be hardened at a time a better method, more economical in labor and
material, is to pack the empty cans up to the covers in a large box,
using salt and ice, one to eight. The soft ice cream is poured into
these partly packed cans and when full they are completely covered with
the ice and salt mixture. With such a box it is not necessary to repack
oftener than twice a day.

molds of the ice cream as directed below.

_Receipts_:

    No. 1.
      40 pounds of 20% cream
       8 pounds of sugar
       5 ounces of gelatin in 4 pounds water
       4 ounces of vanilla extract

    No. 2.
      40 pounds of 20% cream
       8 pounds of sugar
       5 ounces of gelatin in 4 pounds water
       1 quart pulped strawberries
       4 ounces strawberry extract
         Color pink

    No. 3.
      40  pounds of 20% cream
       8  pounds of sugar
       5  ounces of gelatin in 4 pounds water
       3  ounces of vanilla extract
       1¼ pounds chocolate with 4 pounds of water and one pound of sugar
             (cocoa may be used if desired).

Fill the outside of a few center mold bricks with vanilla ice cream.
Harden in a salt and ice mixture one part salt to two parts of ice.
When hard withdraw the center mold and fill with the strawberry or
chocolate ice cream. Again pack in salt and ice to harden.

Fill a few fancy individual molds and pack in the salt and ice mixture
till hard.

Each student should make a 3 layer tri-colored brick. First prepare the
molds, attach your name and pack in salt and ice to become thoroughly
cold. As the vanilla ice cream is drawn from the freezer fill each mold
one third full and pack in the salt and ice mixture, so that it will be
hardened by the time the strawberry ice cream is ready to be drawn off.
Then fill another one third with the strawberry. Finish filling with
the chocolate, being sure to have the brick so full of soft cream that
no brine can enter under the lid. Care should be taken each time to
have the bricks set level in the salt and ice.

SCORE CARD FOR ICE CREAM


The comparison of ice creams is accomplished best by reducing their
quality to a numerical basis. This is done by use of a score card. Two
score cards are suggested as follows:

                              _Modification of the_
    _Cornell Score Card        Wisconsin Score Card_

    Flavor             45    Flavor             40
    Body and texture   35    Body and texture   25
    Richness           10    Bacterial count    15
    Appearance          5    Richness           10
    Package             5    Appearance          5
                      ———     Package            5
                                               ———
                      100                      100

It may be more advantageous to use the Cornell score card in the
Laboratory because immediate results can be obtained, while with the
modified Wisconsin score card bacterial counts must be made of the ice
cream, so that it would be two to three days before the final score of
the ice cream could be obtained.


DISCUSSION OF QUALITIES OF ICE CREAM

_Flavor._ The ice cream should have a pronounced flavor which will
blend with the flavor of the cream to give a clean, desirable typical
flavor.

_Body and Texture._ The body should be firm and mellow. It should not
be tough or rubbery neither soft or mushy. The texture should be smooth
and velvety and entirely free from graininess and lumpiness.

_Richness._ If the ice cream meets the legal requirements, it should
be given a perfect score. If it falls below the legal requirement, it
should be scored zero.

_Appearance._ The ice cream should have an attractive appearance and be
of the characteristic uniform color.

_Package._ The package should be neat and clean and, if for long
shipment, some provision should be made to protect the ice on top of
the packing tub.

_Bacterial count._ An ice cream which has a count of 20,000 should be
considered perfect. For each increase of 20,000 above this one point
should be deducted from the score.

_Application of score card._ When judging samples of ice cream, it is
best to try some of them to obtain some idea of the qualities of the
samples to be scored. This is necessary so that the score will not run
above 100 and to set a standard. Then with a definite standard in mind,
the samples may be carefully scored. The cuts in score should be made
in proportion to the quality of the ice cream and the definite standard
in mind.




EXERCISE NUMBER XX

JUDGING PLAIN ICE CREAM


Score and criticize the samples of plain ice cream recording the scores
on the opposite page. (For score card see page 64.)

One sample will first be scored by the instructor as an example and
guide to the severeness of the cut for different defects. After the
students have finished, he will score the remaining samples with them.

Three of the samples are ice cream made in the college laboratory. The
others are purchased and represent well known commercial ice creams.

After scoring on all other points make a fat test of each sample. (See
page 14.)
