                 CARE AND CLEANING{decorative drawing}


You will find that your Gas Range is as easy to care for as it is to
use. The following suggestions will help keep it looking—and
cooking—like new. Remember, good care means longer wear and maximum good
service from any household appliance.

                        AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION:

1. Use correct flame size. A flame which is too high will cause
spattering and spillovers. Also, avoid overfilling utensils.

2. Before putting utensils into the oven or on a surface burner, be sure
outside of pan is thoroughly clean.

3. Time cooking operations properly, and use _CORRECT TEMPERATURES_ for
roasting, baking and thermostatic top burner cooking. This will not only
give you better cooking results, but also eliminate the possibility of
spillovers and hard-to-clean pans.

4. A little care regularly keeps a range like new and is much easier
than waiting until stains are cooked on and a major cleaning job is
necessary. All surfaces can safely be washed with detergent and hot
water. To retain the original appearance, RINSE and wipe surfaces dry
after washing.

5. To keep the fine porcelain enamel and polished metal finishes free of
scratches, avoid the use of gritty, harsh cleansers and abrasives which
in time take away the shiny new finish.

6. If acid foods such as fruit juices, vinegar, coffee, tea or milk are
spilled on the range, wipe them off immediately to guard against
permanent discoloration of the finish.

7. Never place extremely hot utensils on the porcelain finished areas.

                           THE POUND OF CURE:

1. If there is a spillover when the range is warm, wipe off with a dry
cloth or paper towel. After the range is cool, finish cleaning with warm
water and a mild soap, or wash with a solution of 3 tablespoons baking
soda dissolved in 1 quart of warm water. Rinse in clear warm water and
dry with soft cloth.

2. Never scrape surfaces with a sharp object such as a knife or razor
blade. In most cases, ordinary stains can be removed from the range with
baking soda and a damp cloth. If the stain proves to be stubborn, use a
mild cleanser such as Bon-Ami, Bab-O, or similar cleansers.

3. In most cases, a damp cloth will wipe the chrome surface clean. Use
any one of the many good chrome cleaners if the stains prove to be
stubborn.

4. All removable parts (except aluminum) will clean more easily if
soaked in ammonia and hot water (4 tablespoons to 2 quarts) for a few
hours.

5. If food spills over in the oven, sprinkle with salt to stop smoke and
odor. Clean as soon as finished baking. Failure to do so may result in a
permanently pitted surface.


                                COOK TOP

BURNERS

Burners can be wiped off without removing them from the range. However,
they are removable for an occasional thorough washing in a solution of
detergent water. Remove stubborn spots with a damp cloth and baking
soda. They may be placed in an inverted position in a warm oven to be
dried. It is not necessary to boil burners. Be sure to fit burners
securely back into place.

                              BURNER PORTS

To clean top burner ports, use a pipe cleaner which has been dipped in
ammonia or a wire, such as a straightened out paper clip rather than a
toothpick which could break off and further clog the ports.

                      THERMOSTATIC SENSING DEVICE

Cooking is carefree and accurate if the sensing device of the
thermostatic top burner is kept clean. Simply wipe with a damp cloth or
remove stubborn spots with SOAPLESS, fine steel wool. Generally the
sensing devices do not lift out, however, there are exceptions. Refer to
your range manufacturer’s manual for specific instructions.

                    BURNER BOWLS, GRIDS, DRIP TRAYS

Burner bowls, grids and drip trays can be removed for washing at the
sink. Wash with mild detergent and hot water. If especially soiled, soak
in a solution of hot ammonia water. Remove stubborn spots with a damp
cloth and baking soda.

                             BURNER CONTROL

Burner control knobs are removable. Be sure control is in OFF position
before removing knob. If knobs do not remove easily, slide a dish towel
or cloth under the edge of the knob; encircle the knob and pull. Wash
with mild detergent and hot water.


                                  OVEN

OVEN INTERIOR

The oven interior and all removable parts clean much easier if a small
dish of undiluted household ammonia is allowed to stand in it for
several hours or overnight prior to washing. In most cases, cleaning can
be completed with hot soapy water. Baking soda or a mild cleanser can be
used on stubborn spots and stains. Soap filled steel wool pads may be
used if well moistened and used gently.

Teflon-lined oven: Refer to range manufacturer’s instruction booklet.

                              OVEN WINDOWS

Oven windows are not removable in most ranges. Wash in place with mild
detergent and water or a solution of baking soda and water (3
tablespoons to 1 cup water).

                               OVEN DOORS

Oven doors are removable on some ranges for easy cleaning. Also, once
removed, access to the oven interior is easy. Refer to your range
manufacturer’s manual regarding this feature.

                              OVEN BOTTOM

The oven bottom and oven racks are easily removed for cleaning at the
sink in mild detergent and water. If necessary, clean with fine steel
wool pads, rinse well and wipe dry. Be sure to replace in correct
position for even heat distribution.

                               MEAT PROBE

A meat probe should not be immersed in water when cleaned. Wipe with a
damp cloth.

A meat probe is a delicate instrument which should not be abused. When
disconnecting the probe after cooking, grasp the plug on one end and the
solid part of the probe on the other end. DO NOT PULL ON THE CABLE AT
ANY TIME.

Also, the meat probe should not be stored in the oven or other parts of
the range. Since the probe could become defective if it is exposed to
350 degrees or over, it should be stored at room temperature.


                                BROILER

Broiler pan cleaning can be minimized by removing the broiler pan BEFORE
preheating broiler compartment. Cold food placed on a hot broiler pan
will stick before it is placed in the broiler. After food is cooked,
remove it AND the broiler pan from broiler compartment. Drippings will
bake on the broiler pan if left in a hot broiler compartment. As soon as
food has been removed from the broiler pan pour off grease. Sprinkle pan
and insert with soap powder or liquid detergent and cover with a hot
damp cloth or wet paper towels. Drippings will steam and loosen while
the meal is being served. A soapy fine steel wool pad may also be used
if needed. Do not cover broiler pan insert with aluminum foil during
broiling. Grease MUST be allowed to drip through the broiler pan insert
into the lower pan away from the heat.

                              ACCESSORIES

ROTISSERIE

Rotisserie with burner above food: Use broiler pan without insert as a
drip pan. Keep at least ½ inch of water in pan to eliminate spattering
of basting sauces and to aid cleaning.

Rotisserie with indirect heat from oven burner: Water in the rotisserie
pan is not recommended when using this type rotisserie. Since the water
is between the food and the burner—there is too much steaming. Instead,
crumple aluminum foil and place in rotisserie pan to catch drippings and
help reduce spattering.


                                GRIDDLE

To keep a gleaming griddle, turn off the flame when cooking is finished
and wipe the surface with paper towels. When cool, wash with hot soapy
water (not synthetic detergent), rinse and dry thoroughly. Avoid using a
soda or alkaline cleaner.

To preserve the finish of the griddle never scrape it with knives or
other sharp objects.

Overheating or sudden temperature changes can damage a griddle.

Teflon: Refer to manufacturer’s instructions.


                              LIGHT BULBS

If oven light needs replacing, buy a 40 watt Heat Resistant lamp (not an
ordinary light bulb). Turn light switch to OFF position, cover old lamp
with a dry cloth and unscrew; replace with new one. When cleaning, do
not touch hot lamp with a wet cloth; it may break.

TOP BURNERS

Gas burners provide a thousand and one shades of heat from high to very
low to suit every cooking need. Heat is supplied instantly, and there is
no leftover heat when the burner is turned off. To use the burner, turn
the burner control until the burner ignites; then turn to adjust the
flame size. Some burners have audible “clicks” to indicate heat
settings.

                               FLAME SIZE

Correct flame size is determined by pan size, pan material, what you are
cooking and whether you are cooking with liquid. Even when cooking in a
liquid or with a pan which conducts heat well, you may want to lower the
flame to adjust for pan size (see sketch below). The flame should never
extend beyond the outer edge of the utensil. Any higher flame is wasted
heat.

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

For all cooking in aluminum utensils or for cooking in liquid in other
utensils, adjust the flame so it touches the pan about ½ inch from the
outer edge.

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

For non-aluminum pans (unless you are cooking in liquid) adjust the
flame so it is about half the diameter of the pan.

Foods cook just as quickly at a gentle boil as at a rapid rolling
boil—in both cases the water temperature is 212 degrees. A high boil is
used only to bring food to the boiling point; then lower the flame and
finish cooking with a minimum flame.

EXCESS HEAT RESULTS IN HARD-TO-CLEAN GREASE AND STEAM DEPOSITS ON WALLS,
CABINETS AND CEILINGS. WHILE THE FUEL IS OFTEN BLAMED FOR SUCH DIRT, THE
REAL PROBLEM IS TOO MUCH HEAT AND/OR FAILURE TO COVER UTENSILS WHENEVER
POSSIBLE.

                               HIGH FLAME

For instant heat needed to bring foods to a rapid boil.

                              MEDIUM FLAME

To brown and fry food.

                              SIMMER FLAME

To maintain gentle boil for boiling or steaming, cream sauces, gravies,
puddings, etc.

                               KEEP WARM

To keep foods hot without additional cooking; melting and keeping hot
beverages at serving temperature. Always cover utensils with this
setting.

                            FLAME ADJUSTMENT

Of all its advantages, the cleanliness of GAS is perhaps the greatest. A
properly adjusted Gas flame is one of the cleanest energy sources known.

The color of the flame is the key to proper burner adjustment. A good
flame is clear and blue and hardly visible in a well lighted room. Each
cone of flame should be steady and sharply defined.


                  A THOUGHT OR TWO ABOUT A POT OR TWO

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

  Cooking is easier with the correct pan; a well designed pan. Look for
  these characteristics when selecting new pans:

                              GOOD BALANCE

aids even heating and ease of use. The pan should set level with or
without food.

                           WELL FITTED COVER

helps to retain moisture, flavor and nutrients during the cooking
process. It keeps temperature in the pan more even and holds in heat,
aroma, and steam. Cover pans whenever you can so foods cook with maximum
speed and minimum clean-up. Cooking with a cover will require a lower
flame setting than will be needed for the same food cooked uncovered.

                         HEAT-RESISTANT HANDLE

aids in easy handling of the utensil and avoids discomfort or burn.

                        DENT-RESISTANT MATERIAL

aids in retaining the original shape of the pan to insure good lid fit
and ease in cleaning.

                      GOOD HEAT CONDUCTOR MATERIAL

insures more even heating of the pan and more even browning or cooking.
Examples of good heat conducting materials are: aluminum or
aluminum-clad stainless steel. Materials which conduct heat slowly
(stainless steel, cast iron, glass and enamel) may require special
attention for desired results. GENERALLY, LOWER FLAME HEIGHTS ARE BEST
FOR NON-ALUMINUM UTENSILS.




        COOKING ON THE “BURNER-WITH-A-BRAIN”{decorative drawing}


            THERMOSTATIC TOP BURNER WITH FLAME SIZE CONTROL

This new flexible control permits you to cook automatically in utensils
of many types and sizes. Temperature is thermostatically controlled by a
sensing device in the center of the burner. The sensing device, in
contact with the pan bottom, transmits food temperature to a thermostat
which maintains any degree of heat you select, automatically.

The flame size control is an added convenience to permit easy adjustment
of the height of the flame on the burner. The size of flame should be
selected to fit the size or type of cooking utensil, or the kind of food
or cooking to be done. A low size flame is best for small utensils, for
non-aluminum pans (stainless steel, cast iron, glass and enamel), and
foods requiring a temperature of 200 degrees or below.

                     TIMED OR PROGRAMMED TOP BURNER

Some thermostatic top burners are available which can be set to cook at
any temperature, then AUTOMATICALLY reduce to a holding temperature. For
details, refer to manufacturer’s instruction booklet.

              ADVANTAGES OF “BURNER-WITH-A-BRAIN” COOKING:

1. Food is better because each food can be cooked at the most desirable,
accurate temperature.

2. Cooking is more carefree because the temperature selected is
maintained automatically. Burning, scorching, boil-overs and
pot-watching are eliminated.

3. After cooking the food can be held on the “LOW” setting when there
are unavoidable delays at serving time. Even mashed potatoes will stay
hot and fluffy without scorching!

4. Results are excellent when doing special types of cooking such as
deep fat frying, griddle cooking, warming leftovers, popcorn, skillet
meals, and sensitive foods such as custards and cream sauces because it
assures even, accurate temperature control.

                             BEST RESULTS:

1. Use flat bottomed utensils which make good contact with the sensing
device. Try also to choose pans that fit the quantity of food you are
cooking. Utensils perform best when nearly full.

2. Aluminum conducts heat very well and is ideal for use on the
thermostatic top burner.

3. Do not use glass utensils unless food is cooked in liquid.

4. The top of the sensing device and the bottom of the utensil should be
kept clean.

5. In frying foods, particularly meats, make certain that the center of
the pan over the sensing device is covered with food.

6. Generally, lower flame heights are best for non-aluminum utensils.

7. When meats with bones are pan broiled and insufficient fat is
obtained from the meat, it may be necessary to add a small amount of
shortening to insure good contact between pan and meat.

8. Frying in pyroceram (Corningware) requires low flame size and 25 to
50 degrees lower temperature.

9. When cakes, breads or desserts are baked on the thermostatic top
burner, the top of the food has a slightly steamed appearance. Remove
cover for last 5 minutes to allow food to dry on top.

10. Preheating is necessary when pan frying, deep fat frying, pan
broiling and griddle cooking. Put the shortening in the pan (except for
pan broiling) and set the thermostatic control at the flame size and
temperature recommended for the food being cooked. When the temperature
is reached, the flame will automatically lower or diminish completely
and you can begin to fry then or whenever you are ready. The burner will
automatically increase or decrease the flame as needed to maintain the
selected temperature.

11. Tight-fitting lids keep heat, moisture and flavor inside the pan and
should be used for warming, melting, simmering, steaming and most
boiling. Cooking without a cover will require a higher temperature
setting than will be needed for the same food cooked covered. Frying and
pan broiling do not require covers.

12. It may be helpful to record the temperature settings which give you
the best results.


                     TIME AND TEMPERATURE GUIDE FOR
                         “BURNER-WITH-A-BRAIN”

Personal taste, the quantity of food and other factors may necessitate a
slightly higher or lower temperature. Reduce flame size for all small
utensils before selecting temperature and for nonaluminum pans
(stainless steel, cast iron, glass and enamel). To fry in pyroceram
(Corningware) utensils, lower temperature 25 degrees to 50 degrees.

ALUMINUM IS THE BEST HEAT CONDUCTOR AND IS IDEAL FOR USE ON THERMOSTATIC
TOP BURNER.

                   RECIPES FOR “BURNER-WITH-A-BRAIN”


                           TOASTED POUND CAKE

For a simple but delicious dessert, toast slices of pound cake. Preheat
griddle on the thermostatic top burner at 300 degrees. Cut slices of
pound cake one inch thick; butter both sides or leave plain, depending
on your flavor preference. When flame lowers, grill on hot griddle for
about 3 minutes per side or until nicely browned. Serve plain or topped
with ice cream and/or sauce.


                             WARMING ROLLS

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

Wrap rolls or muffins in double thickness of aluminum foil, folding
edges under tightly. Place foil wrapped package on rack or crumpled
aluminum foil in aluminum skillet or saucepan on thermostatic top burner
at 250 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes or until heated through.


                            HARD COOKED EGGS

  Eggs
  1 Tbsp. water for EACH egg

Place eggs and water in pan. Cover with tight fitting lid. Cook on
thermostatic top burner at 200 degrees for 20 minutes. Remove from
flame, pour off hot water and immediately cool with cold water. Peel
immediately or refrigerate, peeling later. This method of preparation
eliminates pot watching, cracked eggs and dark ring around yolks.


                           “PAN BAKED” APPLES

Wash and core 6 baking apples. Add a dash of cinnamon, one Tbsp. sugar
and a dot of butter to each apple. Place apples in skillet or saucepan.
Add one Tbsp. water for each apple to be cooked. Cover and cook on
thermostatic top burner at 212 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes. Spoon sauce
in bottom of skillet over each apple before serving.


                          “PAN BAKED” POTATOES

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

Place scrubbed potatoes on a rack or on crumpled aluminum foil in
aluminum skillet or saucepan. Do not add water or wrap potatoes in foil.
Cover skillet or saucepan and bake on thermostatic top burner at 375
degrees until done, about 1 to 1½ hours.


                     “BUTTER BOIL” FROZEN VEGETABLE

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

Break up frozen vegetable by pounding package against edge of counter.
Place vegetable in saucepan with 2 to 3 tablespoons butter and ½
teaspoon salt. For starchy vegetables like lima beans and corn, 1 or 2
tablespoons of water may be needed. Cook on thermostatic top burner at
210 degrees. Cook time indicated on package plus 5 minutes.

NOTE: To prevent breaking spears of asparagus and broccoli, thaw just
enough to break apart.


                              FLUFFY RICE

For 3 cups of cooked white rice, place 1 cup uncooked rice, 2 cups water
and 1 teaspoon salt in 2-qt. saucepan. Place on thermostatic top burner
at 225 degrees. Bring to a boil, then cover pan, lower temperature
setting to 190 degrees, and simmer about 15 minutes or until water is
absorbed and rice is tender. For extra fluffy rice, turn burner off and
let rice stand, covered for 10 minutes more.

Brown and wild rice are best cooked this way also, but cooking time will
be much longer—about 35 to 45 minutes total cooking time. Also, add
about ½ cup more water.


                                POPCORN

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

Place 2 tablespoons of oil and ½ cup popcorn in 10-inch aluminum skillet
or saucepan. Cover tightly and place on thermostatic top burner at 375
degrees. Heat until popping stops, about 3 minutes. No need to shake the
pan. Pour into serving bowl and toss with melted butter and salt.


                       TO USE PRESSURE SAUCEPANS

Pressure cooking is extremely easy with a thermostatic top burner. The
following temperatures may be used as a guide: 240° to 250° for 15
pounds pressure, 235° to 240° for 10 pounds, and 225° to 235° for 5
pounds. Use medium flame if the pressure saucepan is of non-aluminum
material. Raise or lower the temperature if needed to maintain the
correct pressure; once it is determined, record it for future use. Time
pressure cooking from the time the desired pressure is reached.


                            DEEP FAT FRYING

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

Accurate top burner temperature control makes deep fat frying just as
easy as boiling water. Use a deep aluminum skillet or French fryer so
oil will only half fill it and completely cover food. Preheat oil at
recommended temperature (usually 375 to 400 degrees) until flame lowers,
about 10 minutes. Add food in small amounts, cook until brown, turning
once. Remove and drain on absorbent paper.


                              PAN BROILING

Set thermostatic top burner at 275 to 350 degrees depending on kind of
meat and thickness. Preheat the griddle or skillet until the flame
reduces. Rub pan lightly with a bit of meat fat. Brown meat on both
sides. Do not cover. Do not add water. Pour off fat as it accumulates in
pan. Turn meat occasionally so that it cooks evenly. Season and serve.


                           HAM SKILLET DINNER

  1 ham slice, ½-inch thick
  1 tsp. butter or margarine
  8 small potatoes
  1 pkg. (10-oz) frozen green beans
  ½ C. chopped onion
  ½ tsp. salt
  Dash pepper
  ½ C. water

Brown ham slice on both sides in butter in large skillet. Add potatoes,
green beans, onion, salt, pepper and water. Cover and place on
thermostatic top burner at 215 degrees for 30 minutes. Makes 4 servings.


                      APPLESAUCE UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE

  ½ pkg. applesauce spice cake mix (plus ingredients necessary to
          prepare according to directions on pkg.)
  6 Tbsp. butter or margarine
  ¾ C. brown sugar, packed
  1 C. canned apple slices, drained
  ¼ C. maraschino cherries

Prepare cake mix according to directions on package. Combine butter and
brown sugar in 10-inch skillet; heat enough to melt and blend together.

                      GRIDDLE{decorative drawing}


One type of griddle is designed by the range manufacturer to fit over
one of the surface burners. It can usually be converted to a fifth
burner and is often thermostatically controlled. The other type is a
portable separate utensil which fits over any range burner.

The griddle should be seasoned before using for the first time. To do
this, brush surface with unsalted shortening. Heat on thermostatic top
burner at 325 degrees for 15 minutes. Turn flame off and allow griddle
to cool. While griddle is still warm, wipe off excess shortening with
paper towel. The griddle is now ready for use.

The recommended thermostatic controlled burner temperature or a medium
flame should be used when grilling foods. If griddle has no temperature
indicator or is not thermostatically controlled, use a few drops of
water as a test for proper cooking temperature. The water will form
beads and “dance” when the griddle is ready to use.




                             GRILLING GUIDE


Preheat griddle at high flame and recommended temperature. Rub griddle
lightly with a bit of meat fat.

 IT’S EASY TO BAKE WITH ... THE MODERN FUEL ... GAS{decorative drawing}


                          BLUE FLAME OVEN TIPS

The oven should be allowed to preheat 10 to 15 minutes for most baking
and all roasting operations.

Arrange pans 1½ inches from sides of oven and from each other for best
heat circulation. There should also be 1½ inches of air space above and
below each pan.

It is possible to use both racks at the same time in a Gas oven and
still be assured of even browning. Two sheets of cookies or 4 layers of
cake can be baked without shifting the pans. When using two racks and
several pans, stagger the pans so no pan is squarely above another.

The most desirable baking results are obtained when the correct pan is
used. Use the size pan recommended in the recipe. Use a medium weight
aluminum or glass cake pan. Do not expect warped or darkened pans to
produce even browning or a level product.

If food runs over in the oven, sprinkle with salt to stop smoking. Clean
as soon as baking has been completed and oven has cooled.

Use minute timer to remind you when to check foods.

With a window in the door and an interior oven light, the cooking
progress may be checked without opening the door. Leave oven door closed
at least until the minimum baking time has elapsed.

When baking in glass pans, lower recommended temperature 25 degrees and
use the recommended time.

For mixes, packaged and frozen foods, follow label directions. Remember,
however, that cooking times are approximate and can be adjusted to suit
personal preferences.

The non-tip oven rack may be pulled out for loading and unloading the
oven without reaching into the heated oven.

Oven meals requiring same time and temperature for all foods have been
planned on the following pages. Your own favorite recipes can also be
cooked and held automatically with the new programmed system.

                          USE OF ALUMINUM FOIL

If aluminum foil is used in the oven, place a small sheet in the center
of the oven bottom. The heated air MUST be allowed to circulate freely
through the openings toward the outer edge of the oven bottom. DO NOT
completely cover the oven bottom. DO NOT cover an oven rack with foil.
Use aluminum foil only when absolutely necessary. DO NOT leave foil in
the oven permanently. If these instructions are not followed, damage to
the range and unsatisfactory baking results can be expected.

                               MEAT PROBE

A meat probe is a device for measuring, indicating and/or controlling
internal temperature of meats by means of a metal probe inserted into
the roast and linked to an indicator or actuator. This convenience
feature eliminates guesswork and insures perfection every time.

Wipe meat with a clean, damp cloth. Season and place, fat side up, on
rack in shallow roasting pan. Basting is not necessary.

When inserting probe into meat, put center section of probe into the
lean center muscle away from bone and fat and as near the center of the
meat as possible. When in use, the meat probe tip should be INSIDE the
meat, not sticking through the meat and out the other side.

Always make certain the full length of probe is inserted in the meat.
This may mean the probe will be inserted at an angle to have tip in
center of muscle.

Plug other end of cable into socket in oven wall.

Turn selector dial to desired degree of doneness.

Set oven thermostat to 325 degrees.

DO NOT put an aluminum foil cover on meat when probe is used.

When roasting is completed, the control automatically signals, turns the
oven off and/or reduces to and maintains a keep-warm temperature,
depending on the type of thermometer.

Refer to manufacturer’s instruction booklet for further information.

You will notice the following characteristics with the new
low-temperature oven control:

1. After turning the oven control to the desired temperature, there will
be a slight delay (several seconds) before the oven burner comes on.

2. The oven burner turns on and off as the oven operates except at the
“Broil” setting. Baking times and temperatures are not affected by the
“off-on” control.

                               PREHEATING

When using temperatures below 225°, preheating is generally recommended.
To preheat, just turn the control to the temperature you want. It is not
necessary to turn it first to a higher setting. Allow 10 minutes for
preheating.

                            COOLING THE OVEN

Many ranges have the special feature of programmed cooking which reduces
the cooking temperature to the keep-warm setting automatically. However,
there are two ways to cool the oven manually to a lower holding
temperature:

1. The quickest method is to turn the oven control to the desired
low-temperature setting and open the oven door for 10 to 15 minutes to
allow excess heat to escape. Then close the door until ready to serve
the food.

2. A second method of cooling is to turn the oven control to the lower
setting about 15 minutes before the end of the usual cooking time for
the food you are preparing. Let the oven cool with the door closed. As
the oven cools gradually to the keep-warm temperature, the food will
finish cooking. If the oven door is opened during this cool down period
(approximately 45 minutes after you lower the temperature) additional
cooking time may be needed.

                        KEEPING WHOLE MEALS WARM

The setting recommended for the main course is usually a good compromise
if all the foods in a meal do not have the same recommended keep-warm
temperature.

                             COVERING FOODS

Moist foods should be tightly covered; many foods need only a loose
cover. Aluminum foil makes an ideal cover if the utensil has no lid.

                              CARVING MEAT

Generally it is best to wait until just before serving to carve
meats—especially rare or medium meats. However, if you do wish to carve
meats ahead of time, keep the exposed cut surfaces close together and
cover lightly with dampened paper towels or a dampened tea towel.

                      PRO-TEN® (PRE-TENDERED) BEEF

The papain used as a tendering agent continues to tenderize while the
meat is held at keep-warm temperatures. As a result, these meats can
become too tender after a holding period. Cuts which are not naturally
tender, such as chuck and brisket, hold best but should be served within
1 to 2 hours after cooking is completed.

                   WARMING SERVING DISHES AND PLATES

Preheat the oven and warm dishes at 170°. Allow 10 to 20 minutes to warm
dishes thoroughly. Do not set warm dishes on a cold surface as rapid
temperature changes can cause cracking. Warm only china, pottery,
earthenware or enamelware (not silver).

                    TO THAW AND FRESHEN BAKED GOODS

Preheat oven to 170°. Wrap baked goods loosely to prevent drying and
permit evaporation of ice crystals formed during freezing. This
low-temperature oven method thaws three to four times faster than at
room temperature.

                              HOLDING TIME

Most cooked foods may be held safely at serving temperature for 4 hours
after cooking is completed. However, food is most palatable and
nutritious when served reasonably soon after cooking. Therefore, keep
foods warm no longer than necessary—preferably no more than 1½ to 2
hours.

Top burner cooked foods are most attractive when held an hour or less.
Green vegetables are especially subject to color and texture changes.




              KEEP-WARM TEMPERATURES FOR OVEN COOKED FOODS


Foods should be still hot from cooking—These temperatures will keep them
hot for serving.

                 PROGRAMMED COOKING{decorative drawing}


One of the most outstanding, truly automatic features of the Gas range
is the programmed oven. Oven programming means that the oven will
automatically change at a set time from one temperature to
another—usually from a cooking to a keep-warm temperature. In other
words, set the oven control for the cooking temperature and the amount
of cooking time. The oven will cook the food, then automatically reduce
to a keep-warm temperature to hold the foods for serving without
over-cooking or drying out.

                      A. Foods which program well:

  1. Most main dishes, especially casseroles and foods in sauces.
  2. Covered foods.
  3. Yellow vegetables, onions, or beets. Green vegetables, up to 1 to 2
              hours; long holding period causes loss of color.
  4. Roasts and other large cuts of meat.
  5. Rice, noodles, macaroni.

B. Foods which should not be programmed:

  1. Foods such as cookies, pies, and cakes which require exact cooking
              times should be removed from oven immediately. If they are
              to be kept warm, they should be rewrapped to prevent
              drying and then placed in the keep-warm oven.
  2. Foods to be served immediately—souffles.
  3. Broiled foods.

C. General rules:

  1. Food may be held with safety for 4 hours after cooking is
              completed, but will be most palatable served within 1½ to
              2 hours.
  2. Any food which holds well in the low temperature oven usually
              programs well also.
  3. FOR SPECIFIC PROGRAMMED OVEN FEATURES, REFER TO YOUR RANGE

Many variables such as size, composition and initial temperature of the
meat are often encountered in roasts of the same weight. Therefore, the
oven timer settings can only be approximate. For more accurate and
unattended meat roasting a meat probe is recommended.

                      BROILER{decorative drawing}


Broiling is a fast method of cooking. It is smokeless because the
broiler flame literally consumes any smoke formed. It is cool because it
is done with the oven and broiler compartment doors closed.

There are no set rules for broiler cooking time because foods vary,
personal preferences differ and broiler burners vary in speed and
performance characteristics according to type.

                         GENERAL BROILING TIPS

{decorative drawing}

Always broil with full flame unless otherwise specified in recipe. If
recipe requires low flame, preheat on full flame first; then lower flame
to about 325 degrees to broil food. When preheating, remove the broiler
pan from the broiler compartment. Preheat broiler 5 to 10 minutes. This
speeds up broiling and gives browner and juicier meats. If broiler is
not preheated, allow a few extra minutes on the broiling time.

Do not use aluminum foil on the broiler insert, for it will block the
insert openings and prevent drainage of fat and drippings.

Allowances must be made for broiling large quantities of meat at one
time by lowering broiler pan position.

Meat for broiling should be tender, but need not be expensive.
Hamburgers, weiners, etc. are tasty when broiled.

Veal and fresh pork should not be broiled. Veal is too lean. Pork
requires long, slow cooking to be eaten safely.

Always turn meat with tongs, as piercing it with a fork will cause
unnecessary loss of meat juices.

Allow meat to brown well on the first side before turning it.

When turning meat, place on its original spot to cover the greasy area
and prevent unnecessary charring on the pan insert.

Although it is possible to broil frozen meat, a better product is
obtained by thawing before broiling. However, if frozen, increase
distance from the burner and allow more time than the chart indicates.

In a Gas range that has a broiler below the oven, it is possible to bake
and broil at the same time. Ham, fish, chicken, sandwiches, cold cuts
and fruit are just a few of the foods than can be broiled using a low
flame. Broiling time will be lengthened by this method. Meat will have a
less crusty surface but will be tender and juicy.


INFRARED BROILING GUIDE

Remove broiler pan before preheating. Use high flame for preheating and
cooking. Preheat 5 minutes.

REHEATING FOOD IN THE INFRARED BROILER

Food that has been cooked, reheats exceptionally well in the infrared
broiler. Preheat as usual. Use High flame. Turning is optional.

                           BEFORE REHEATING:

Food should be at room temperature, if possible. Brush fruits and
vegetables with butter.

                           DISTANCE AND TIME:

Varies with thickness and quantity of food. Hamburger, chops, chicken
and seafood reheat successfully at the same distance and time required
when originally cooked.

Roasted meat, sliced ¼-inch thick, reheats successfully 3 inches from
the flame in 2 to 3 minutes. Turning is not necessary.

                            BROILER RECIPES


                             BROILED STEAKS

Steak is probably the most popular meat in America and certainly there
is nothing more hearty or satisfying than a good steak, thick and juicy,
and sizzling hot right from the broiler.

Figure ¾ to 1 pound of steak per person. It should be at least 1-inch
thick. Trim away excess fat and slash remaining edge of fat to prevent
curling.

To test a thick steak for doneness, make a small cut with a sharp knife
near the bone.

When steak is done as desired, season with salt and pepper, spread with
softened butter and serve on a hot platter.

The distance from the flame depends upon thickness of the meat and
doneness preferred—the rarer the steak, the nearer to the flame. Broil
until nicely browned; turn and finish cooking the second side.

PREHEAT BROILER COMPARTMENT 5 TO 10 MINUTES FLAME-HIGH

RARE: Place so top of meat is 1½ to 2 inches from flame. Broil 8 to 10
minutes, turning once.

MEDIUM: Place so top of meat is 2 to 3 inches from flame. Broil 12 to 18
minutes, turning once.

WELL-DONE: Place so top of meat is 3 to 5 inches from flame. Broil 20 to
25 minutes, turning once.


                            BROILED CHICKEN

{decorative drawing}

Preheat broiler compartment 5 to 10 minutes. Select 1½ to 2-lb. chicken
for broiling. Split in half lengthwise. Break the wing, hip and leg
joints to keep chicken flat. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange
chicken skin side down on cold broiler pan. Brush with melted butter or
margarine, if desired. Broil on the first side until brown, about 15
minutes; turn skin side up and broil until done. Total broiling time
varies from 35 to 50 minutes. One chicken makes 2 to 3 servings.

  Conventional Broiler:
      DISTANCE—5 TO 8 INCHES
      FLAME—HIGH

  Infrared Broiler:
      DISTANCE—8 TO 9 INCHES
      FLAME—HIGH


                              BROILED FISH

{decorative drawing}

Preheat broiler compartment 5 to 10 minutes. Arrange fish fillets or
steaks on cold broiler pan insert. Place fillets skin side down. Dot
with butter or margarine and sprinkle with salt and paprika. Broil
without turning until golden brown and fish flakes easily when tested
with a fork, 10 to 13 minutes.

1½ lb. fish makes 4 to 6 servings.

  Conventional Broiler:
      DISTANCE—4 INCHES
      FLAME—HIGH

Preheat broiler compartment 5 to 10 minutes. Have ham steak cut ¾ to
1-inch thick. Slash edges of fat to prevent curling. Place ham on cold
broiler pan insert. Broil 10 to 20 minutes, depending on thickness of
ham, turning once.

  Conventional Broiler:
      DISTANCE—3 TO 5 INCHES
      FLAME—HIGH

  Infrared Broiler:
      DISTANCE—5 INCHES

                     ROTISSERIE{decorative drawing}


                            ROTISSERIE TIPS

Foods cooked on the rotisserie require little attention because they
rotate slowly, basting themselves to achieve flavor and appearance.

It is best to bring meat to room temperature before cooking.

Before preheating, check to see that food on rotisserie spit is centered
under the burner and rotating evenly. Reposition food if necessary.

For most accurate test of doneness, use a meat thermometer. It will
indicate internal temperature which is more accurate than estimating
time. Insert carefully so thermometer does not touch fat, bone or
rotisserie spit, or hit any part of compartment when meat is rotating.

Bones and fat are both good conductors of heat, so roasts which have
larger amounts will cook more quickly than lean boneless pieces.

Smaller pieces of meat require a longer cooking time per pound than
large pieces of meat.

Season the cavity of poultry before cooking. Stuff if desired. Tie wings
and legs close to body before securing firmly on rotisserie spit. Season
skin. Brushing with butter is not necessary.

When using High flame, baste only during the last 10 minutes of cooking.
When a longer basting period is desired, it is best to use Low flame.

To make a roast carve more easily, allow the meat to “set” after
cooking. Rare roasts should be covered loosely and allowed to stand in a
Gas oven at 170 degrees for 20 to 30 minutes before carving. The medium
and well-done roasts should be allowed about half this much time.

             COOKING TERMS AND METHODS{decorative drawing}


Note: See pages 12 through 18 to use thermostatic top burner for these
      methods.

BOIL

To cook in a liquid at a temperature of 212 degrees. Visually, bubbles
should rise continually. Method: cover the pan and bring the contents to
a boil over a high flame. Then turn to the simmer flame (first click on
many burners) and continue boiling, covered until done.

                                 BRAISE

To cook meat or poultry by searing in fat, then simmering in a covered
pan in small amount of moisture. Method: generally, meats are seasoned
and rolled in flour and browned in hot fat. Then add a small amount of
liquid and cover the pan. Turn burner valve knob to simmer flame, so
food simmers, not boils, until done.

                              DEEP FAT FRY

To cook in fat deep enough to completely cover the food being cooked. A
saucepan or skillet may be used. Method: use a high flame to bring the
fat to frying temperature (usually 375 degrees), then lower the flame
until it just maintains the desired fat temperature.

                               HIGH BOIL

This term is used to describe a vigorous, rolling boil which cannot be
stirred down. It cooks no faster than a gentle boil but is needed for
cooking foods like macaroni or jellies and jams. Method: cover the pan
and use a high flame to bring the contents to a boil quickly. Then
uncover the pan and turn to a medium flame or enough heat to maintain a
high boil. The food is cooked uncovered in this case to prevent
boil-overs and/or to permit evaporation.

                                  MELT

To liquify a solid food by heat. Method: heat over “keep warm” flame
until liquified. Covering the pan will speed melting.

                               PAN BROIL

To cook uncovered on a hot surface, usually in a skillet, pouring off
fat as it accumulates. Method: heat skillet on “high”. Do not add fat or
water and do not cover. Turn to “simmer” and brown meat slowly on both
sides, pouring off fat as it accumulates.

                            SAUTÉ OR PAN FRY

To cook uncovered in a hot skillet in a small amount of fat. Method:
heat just enough fat or butter to keep the meat from sticking (one to
four tablespoons) in a skillet over a low to medium flame, depending on
the utensil material. Add the food to the hot fat and cook, turning
occasionally, until brown as desired.

                                 SIMMER

To cook in liquid, usually water, at a temperature below the boiling
point. Small bubbles are formed and rise slowly, but the liquid is
practically motionless. Method: cover the pan and bring the food to the
boiling point over a high flame. Then turn to the “simmer” flame.

                                  STEW

To cook foods slowly in a covered pan in enough water to cover the food.
Method: this is the same as braising except that more liquid is used.
The food should simmer, not boil.




                        MEASURING THE RIGHT WAY
      ALWAYS MEASURE ACCURATELY WITH STANDARD MEASURING EQUIPMENT


    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

FLOUR

1. Always sift cake and all-purpose flour before measuring. Sift
pre-sifted flour unless recipe specifically says otherwise. Do not sift
rye, graham or whole wheat flour. Instantized flour cannot be sifted.

2. Sift onto waxed paper. Spoon lightly into dry measuring cup, being
careful not to pack or shake it. Level with straight-edged spatula,
without packing down.

                                LIQUIDS

1. Always set liquid measuring cup on level surface and fill to desired
mark.

2. If thick like molasses or sirup, level off with spatula.

                               SHORTENING

Use graduated measuring cups. Have shortening at room temperature. Pack
firmly into measuring cup. Level off with straight-edged spatula.

                              BROWN SUGAR

Use graduated measuring cup. Pack down in cup with back of spoon, just
enough to hold together when turned out.

                          BUTTER AND MARGARINE

One stick (¼ lb.) equals ½ cup. To measure ¼ cup, cut stick in half. 1
Tbsp. equals ⅛ of a stick. Do not substitute whipped margarine or butter
unless recipe specifically calls for it.

                              DRIED FRUITS

Pack raisins, dates, figs, etc. lightly into measuring cup. Press gently
to level off top.

                            NUTS AND COCONUT

Pack lightly into cup and level off.

                           SOFT BREAD CRUMBS

Pack lightly into measuring cup. Do not press down hard. Level off.

                         FINE DRY BREAD CRUMBS

Spoon lightly into measuring cup and level off. Don’t shake cup.

                       SHREDDED OR GRATED CHEESE

Pack lightly into measuring cup and level off.
