                 PREFACE TO FIRST AND SECOND EDITIONS.


Admirable as are many of the Jewish cookery books already before the
world, they assume the use of ingredients and processes too expensive
for ordinary use. The want of an orthodox book, dealing with the
preparation of economical dishes, has been keenly felt by us during the
last few years, and it is this that has led us to think our little
handbook may be of service.

In compiling it we have had before us three special objects: 1, To adapt
it to our peculiar dietary laws; 2, To make it suitable for young
housekeepers; and 3, To fit it for use in the cookery classes now fairly
started in our midst.

We cannot claim absolute originality for all our recipes, and indeed
have many authorities to thank for kind help in our task. We feel
convinced, however, that many recipes, which have been treasured for
years in manuscript, will prove new and attractive to some at least of
our readers. In this hope we have overstepped one of our limitations by
including a few old-fashioned, high-class recipes, and some special
hints on Passover and Invalid cookery.

We have stated in all cases the _approximate_ time required for the
preparation of each dish; but it must be remembered that, under
different conditions, the time will vary.

The Appendix is based on our experience in actual teaching in schools,
and will, we hope, be of use in the formation of new cookery centres.

As “the proof of the pudding is in the eating,” we only ask that
judgment may be suspended till some of our recipes have been tried.

                       PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.

The really unexpected success of our little book has induced us to
thoroughly revise it, and add to it a large number of new recipes. We
trust that this will increase its usefulness, and give our readers as
much pleasure in referring to the book as we have had in altering it and
bringing it up to date.

                 SPECIAL HINTS FOR YOUNG HOUSEKEEPERS.


1. In making soups or gravies which require colouring the outer skins of
the onion should be left on. Mushroom skins are also useful for this
purpose, and impart a pleasant flavour.

2. When thickening soups, gravies, etc., mix the flour, cornflour,
arrowroot, etc., to a smooth cream with _cold_ liquid first, then stir
continually from the bottom and against the sides of the saucepan or
other vessel to prevent lumps.

3. The dripping from roast mutton, when used for making pastry,
sometimes has an unpleasant flavour. If a few drops of vinegar and of
oil be beaten up with it, it will be found quite as good as beef
dripping.

4. Home-dried herbs are much cheaper than bought ones. About June buy
the herbs, rinse them slightly in cold water, strip off the leaves,
place the various kinds of herbs on separate pieces of white paper, in
the oven or on top of it. When the leaves are quite crisp, rub them
through a wire sieve, and bottle them up tight.

5. When chopping onions, let cold water run on the wrists for a minute.
This will prevent the eyes from watering.

6. When the juice of lemons is required, and the lemons are hard, place
them on a baking sheet in the oven for a few minutes; they will become
quite soft. To keep them from getting mouldy, wrap each one in tissue
paper, and keep separate.

7. Stale scraps of bread should be put in a tin in the oven, and baked a
nice brown. When quite crisp, they should be pounded and bottled. These
“raspings” will be found very useful.

8. Bread should be kept in a glazed earthenware pan, which should have a
cover, and must be cleaned frequently.

9. To disguise the disagreeable odours which often ascend from the
kitchen during the process of cooking, throw a handful of cedar dust on
the top of the grate. (This—called “Dust of Lebanon”—may be obtained of
most stationers at about 4d. per packet.)

10. Milk is the best thing for removing _fresh_ ink stains, but it must
be applied immediately, and the stained part washed.

11. A little powdered sugar sprinkled on a fire, which is almost out,
will invariably revive it. Salt sprinkled on a fire clears it for
grilling, roasting, etc.

12. House flannels should be herringboned all round before they are
used. This ensures their lasting longer, and prevents sinks being
stopped up by the ravellings.

13. It is a decided economy to order soap in large quantities. It should
be cut up when new, and stored for several weeks in a warm place to dry.
Candles also last longer if kept some weeks.

14. All stores should be kept in air-tight tins or glazed jars.

15. Liquid browning, for colouring soups and gravies, should be made as
follows, and kept in a bottle for use:—Put 2 oz. pounded loaf sugar in a
small iron saucepan; let it melt, stirring with an iron spoon; when very
dark (but not black), add ½ pint hot water; let it boil up, and when
cool, bottle it. A few drops are sufficient to colour a quart of liquid.

                             KOSHERING.[1]


Leviticus, ch. xvii. 10, 11:—“And whatsoever man there be of the house
of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any
manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth
blood, and will cut him off from among his people. For the life of the
flesh is in the blood.”

When purchasing meat, care must be taken to see that all veins of blood,
forbidden fat, and the prohibited sinew have been removed. It is the
custom in London to affix a label marked “Porged” on joints from the
hind-quarters, which have been prepared in accordance with our
ordinances.

The following are the Jewish regulations for koshering meat and
poultry:—

The meat is put into a pan, specially reserved for the purpose, and is
then entirely covered with cold water, and left in it for half-an-hour.
Before removing the meat from the water, every clot of blood must be
washed off. It should then be put upon the salting board (a wooden board
perforated with holes), or a basket lid, placed in a slanting position,
so that the water may run off. Finely powdered salt is then sprinkled
profusely over every part of the meat. The meat must remain in salt for
one hour. It is then removed, held over a sink or pan, and well rinsed
with cold water three times, so that all the salt is washed off. Then it
is placed in a clean cloth, and thoroughly dried.

The heart and the lungs must be cut open before being soaked, so that
the blood may flow out. The liver must be prepared apart from other
meat. It must be cut open, washed in cold water, fried over the fire on
a shovel, and, whilst frying, it must be salted. When fried the blood
must be well washed from it.

The head and feet of an animal may be koshered with the hair or skin
adhering thereto. The head should, however, be cut open, the brain
removed and koshered separately. The ends of the claws and hoofs must be
cut off before the feet are koshered.

Poultry is koshered in the same way as meat, taking care that previous
to the soaking in water the whole of the inside be completely removed.

Footnote 1:

  The word _kosher_ means “to render fit or proper for eating.”

                      THE ECONOMICAL JEWISH COOK.




                                 SOUPS.


                    Hints on Making Soups and Stock.

Every housewife should bear in mind that a stock-pot always on the fire
is a great aid to economy. Any odd pieces, trimmings, cooked bones, the
liquor in which meat or poultry has been boiled (commonly known as
_pot-liquor_), should be thrown in, and the pot kept about three parts
full of water. When soup or gravy is required the stock should be well
skimmed, and poured into a clean saucepan. The pot may be of brown
earthenware with a cover and must be cleaned frequently. It should often
be looked over, soft bones removed and fresh ones added.

In preparing soups:—

1. Allow plenty of time, so that all the goodness of the ingredients may
be thoroughly extracted. To do this effectually always put soup-meat
into _cold_ water, so that the outside may not be hardened, and the flow
of the juices may not be checked.

2. Make the stock the day before the soup is wanted.

3. Let the stock boil once; remove the scum, and draw the saucepan to
the side of the fire to _simmer_ only.

4. When the stock is made pour it at once into a clean basin and leave
it uncovered. Remove the fat from the top next morning.

5. Bread fried in boiling oil or fat, and cut into small squares, should
be served with all thick soups.


                   To Make Fresh Stock. Time—5 hours.

Order a melt (cost 8d.) from the butcher. After koshering, skin it, and
notch it across several times; add 2 quarts of cold water, 1 carrot, 1
turnip, 1 onion stuffed with whole peppers and cloves, salt, and simmer
about 5 hours. This will make about 3 pints of good stock, and is more
economical than any other soup-meat.


            Another way of Making Fresh Stock. Time—5 hours.

2 lbs. shin of beef, 1 turnip, 1 carrot, 1 onion, ½ head celery, 1
teaspoonful salt, ½ teaspoonful pepper, 2 quarts cold water.

Cut the meat into pieces, break up the bones, add the cold water and the
salt. Bring to the boil and skim well. Prepare the vegetables, cut them
into pieces, and add them. Simmer 5 hours. This will make about 3 pints
of good stock.


                              White Stock.

Same as above, using knuckle of veal and poultry-bones instead of beef.


                      To Clear Soup. Time—1 hour.

3 pints stock, ½ lb. gravy beef, 1 carrot, 1 turnip, 1 onion.

Chop up the beef fine; clean the vegetables and cut them into small
pieces. After removing all the fat from the stock, which should now be
in the form of jelly, place it in a stew-pan with the meat and
vegetables. Whisk it over the fire until just on boiling point, when it
should be left to boil up well. It should now be clear. Fix a clean
kitchen-cloth on the legs of a chair, placed with its seat on a table;
pour boiling water several times through the cloth into a basin, and
then let the soup run twice slowly through the cloth.

_Another Way._—Use 2 whites of eggs whisked in ½ pint cold water,
instead of the gravy beef.


                      Green Pea Soup. Time—1 hour.

1 pint green peas, 1 quart stock, a few sprigs parsley, a small bunch of
mint, salt and pepper to taste, 1 tablespoonful flour.

Put the stock on, and when it boils add the salt, peas and other
ingredients. When the vegetables are tender pass them through a sieve
with the stock they were boiled in; boil it up again in a clean
stew-pan; thicken it carefully with flour, and cook 10 minutes.


                      Julienne Soup. Time—2 hours.

1 large carrot, 1 small turnip, 2 leeks, 1 onion, ½ head celery, 2 oz.
dripping, 1 cabbage-lettuce, a little tarragon and chervil, 1
teaspoonful sugar, salt to taste, 3 pints stock.

Shred all the vegetables to the same length and size; fry all except the
lettuce, tarragon and chervil, a light brown in the dripping in the
stew-pan. Clear the stock as directed on page 2; boil it and add it with
the sugar and salt to the vegetables; skim well until all grease is
removed, add the lettuce, tarragon, and chervil; let it boil a few
minutes, and serve.


                                 Kugel.

1 pint dried green peas, 1 quart large haricot beans, both soaked
over-night; 2 lbs. clod, 1 large onion stuffed with cloves, 1
tablespoonful flour; salt and pepper to taste.

                               _Pudding._

2 eggs, ¼ lb. suet, ½ lb. flour, ¼ lb. brown sugar, ¼ lb. currants, ¼
lb. raisins or sultanas, 2 oz. candied peel: spice to taste.

Shred the suet and candied peel, wash and dry the currants, stone the
raisins, mix all the dry ingredients together, add the eggs,
well-beaten, place in a greased basin and tie a cloth over. Put the
basin at the bottom of a large earthenware pan; place a plate on the top
of the basin and the meat on this. Throw the peas, beans, onion, pepper,
salt and flour into the pan, cover all with water, and tie a piece of
brown paper over the pan. Put it in the oven when the cooking is
finished on Friday, and dish up when required on Saturday, serving the
soup, meat, and pudding as separate courses.


                       Liver Soup. Time—2 hours.

1 quart pot-liquor, 6 oz. liver, 1 egg, 3 oz. dripping, 2 tablespoonfuls
flour, half small roll; pepper and salt to taste.

Brown the flour in the dripping; add the liver cut in small pieces, the
egg and bread, and let all brown in the pan until thoroughly done a good
dark colour. Pound it, and return to the saucepan with the pepper, salt,
and pot-liquor, to simmer about 1 hour.


                    Mock Turtle Soup. Time—1½ hour.

1 bullock’s foot, 2 lbs. shin of beef, 2 carrots, 2 turnips, 1 small
head celery, 1 leek, 1 onion, 6 oz. dripping, ½ lb. flour; bay-leaves,
cloves, cayenne, and ground mace; 1 wineglassful sherry.

The day before the soup is required cut up the foot and put it in a
saucepan with 2 quarts of cold water; simmer 5 hours, then strain; cut
all the flesh off the bones and chop it up into neat pieces. Put on the
shin separately in 2 quarts of cold water, and simmer 4 or 5 hours.
Prepare the vegetables, cut them up, fry them in the fat in a large
stew-pan; when soft add the flour, and stir till rather brown. Add the
stock from the foot, then that from the shin, the bay-leaves and all the
other ingredients. When it boils pass it all through a sieve, add the
pieces of bullock’s foot, and simmer ½ hour. A little soy may be added
if required. Before serving pour the wine into the bottom of the tureen.


                    Mulligatawny Soup. Time—2 hours.

2 oz. dripping, 2 onions, 2 apples, 2 or 3 carrots, 1 turnip, a few
sticks celery, a bunch of herbs, 2 quarts stock or pot-liquor, 2
tablespoonfuls flour, 1 tablespoonful curry powder, 1 dessertspoonful
curry paste, 1 gill water, 1 teaspoonful salt.

Prepare the vegetables, fry the onions in hot dripping in the stew-pan;
when brown add the apples cut up and cored, carrots, turnip, celery,
herbs and salt. Boil these in the stock. Mix the flour, curry paste and
powder into a smooth paste with the water, pour into the soup, and stir
till it boils. The fat should be skimmed off as it rises. Boil at least
1 hour, and then strain through a sieve. Serve with well-boiled rice
(see page 35).


                   Mutton Broth. Time—2½ to 3 hours.

2 lbs. scrag of mutton, 2 oz. pearl barley or rice, 1 turnip, 1 onion, 1
carrot, 1 leek, 1 teaspoonful chopped parsley, 1 teaspoonful salt, 1
quart water.

Cut the meat into small pieces (removing the fat), and put it into a
saucepan with the bones, cold water and salt; bring to the boil. Draw to
the side of the fire as soon as the broth boils, skim well. Simmer for
1½ hour, skimming occasionally. Prepare the vegetables and rice, add
them and let all simmer ½ hour till the vegetables are tender. Add the
parsley just before serving.


                      Ox-tail Soup. Time—4 hours.

1 ox-tail, 2 oz. dripping, 1 carrot, 1 small turnip, 2 onions, 2
shalots, 1 tooth garlic or 1 leek, a bunch of herbs, a few sticks
celery, a little mace, cinnamon, and 2 cloves, 2 quarts water or
pot-liquor, salt, 2 or 3 mushrooms, 1 gill sherry or chablis.

Prepare the vegetables, cut them up, wash and wipe the ox-tail, cut it
in pieces and fry all in hot dripping in a large stew pan. Add the
herbs, spice, seasoning and water. When boiling skim off the fat and
then stew gently for 3 hours; strain it into a basin, putting the pieces
of ox-tail into the tureen with the sherry or chablis. Pour the soup
into a stew-pan, stir till it boils. Add the mushrooms, and cook from 10
to 15 minutes, skimming off any scum; strain the soup and pour over the
ox-tail.


                       Tomato Soup. Time—1½ hour.

2 quarts stock, 2 lbs. tomatoes or 1 tin tomatoes, 2 leeks, 2 carrots, 2
turnips; pepper and salt to taste; thyme, and half a bay-leaf, 1
teaspoonful chopped parsley, 1 oz. dripping, 2 tablespoonfuls flour.

Prepare and cut up the vegetables, boil all for half an hour in ½ pint
water, and then pulp through a sieve. Warm the dripping in a stew-pan,
stir the flour in smoothly, pour the pulped vegetables and stock on to
it slowly, and let all thicken over the fire.

------------------------------------------------------------------------




                     SAVOURY INGREDIENTS FOR SOUPS.


Vermicelli, macaroni, sago, Italian paste, or semolina, may be thrown
into any clear soup, when boiling, about ¼ hour before it is served.


                         Frimsels. Time—¾ hour.

1 egg, salt, flour.

Beat up the egg well, add a pinch of salt, then, with a knife, work in
as much flour as possible. Flour the board thoroughly, roll out the
paste very thin, cut into three, and roll out each piece till nearly
transparent; then fold into three, let it dry for ¼ of an hour, and with
a sharp knife shave off extremely fine strips. Let these dry, and add
them to the soup when boiling ¼ of an hour before serving.


                      Drop Dumplings. Time—½ hour.

1 tablespoonful beef dripping, 1 egg, 2 tablespoonfuls flour, nutmeg, 1
dessertspoonful chopped parsley, salt and pepper to taste.

Beat up the dripping till quite white; pour some boiling water over the
egg, then break it into the dripping; stir these together, then add the
flour, seasoning, a little grated nutmeg, and the parsley. Drop pieces
the size of a large walnut, into the boiling soup, and cook about 15
minutes.


                   Savoury Custard. Time—40 minutes.

3 yolks of eggs, 2 whites of eggs, 1 gill of stock, a little salt.

Beat up the eggs with the stock and salt; strain into a well-greased
gallipot, cover it with a piece of greased paper, stand it in a saucepan
of boiling water and steam very gently for 30 minutes (the custard would
be full of holes if steamed quickly). When the custard is set, take the
gallipot out of the saucepan, let it get cool, turn the custard out and
cut it up into fancy shapes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------




                              MILK SOUPS.


                 Artichoke or Turnip Soup. Time—1 hour.

1½ lb. sliced artichokes or turnips, 1 oz. butter, 1 tablespoonful
flour, 1½ pint hot milk, 1½ pint hot water, a little cream or good
butter, salt, pepper, and a little sugar.

Heat the butter in a stew-pan, put in the vegetables, turn them about,
add the salt, flour, milk and water, stirring them in slowly. When the
vegetables are done rub them through a sieve, put them back into a clean
stew-pan, add sugar and more seasoning if required and heat thoroughly.
A little cream or good butter may be put into the tureen, and the soup
stirred into it.


                       Cabbage Soup. Time—1 hour.

1 cabbage, 1 tablespoonful parsley, 1 oz. butter, 1 shalot or onion, 1
pint milk, 1¼ pint boiling water, 2 tablespoonfuls semolina, 1
teaspoonful salt, ¼ teaspoonful pepper.

Put on a large saucepan of water to boil; shred the cabbage and put it
into the boiling water to blanch for 5 minutes. Strain the cabbage,
return it to the saucepan with 1¼ pint boiling water, the milk, onion,
chopped parsley, butter, and seasoning. Bring this to the boil and cook
15 minutes; then shake in the semolina and boil 10 minutes.


                       Celery Soup. Time—6 hours.

4 heads celery, 1 small onion, 1 pint water, 1 pint milk, 1 yolk of egg.
Pepper and salt to taste.

Stew the celery and onion in the water for 5 to 6 hours, pulp it through
a sieve, add ¾ pint milk and the seasoning and let it boil once. Draw it
to the side of the fire and add the yolk beaten up in 1 gill cold milk;
stir, but do not let it boil, and serve when hot.


                      Haricot Soup. Time—4½ hours.

1 pint haricot beans, 1 pint milk, 2 quarts water, 1 onion; pepper and
salt to taste.

Soak the beans in water all night. Next morning put them in a saucepan
with the water, pepper, salt, and sliced onion. Boil gently 4 hours.
Then mash all through a sieve into a basin, stir in the milk, and return
to the saucepan to get hot.


                       Potato Soup. Time—1½ hour.

1 lb. potatoes (weighed after they are peeled), ½ oz. butter, 1 onion, 1
pint hot water, ½ pint milk; salt and pepper to taste.

Cut up the potatoes, put them in a stew-pan with the butter and the
onion cut in slices. Stir over the fire for 5 minutes. Add the water,
and simmer for 1 hour. Pass all through a sieve, and return to the
stew-pan. Add the milk, salt, and pepper, and serve when hot.

------------------------------------------------------------------------




                              CHEAP SOUPS.


                       Barley Soup. Time—4 hours.

2 quarts water or pot-liquor, ¼ lb. pearl barley, 2 onions, 2 carrots, a
little chopped parsley; salt and pepper to taste.

Prepare the vegetables, put them with the other ingredients into a
saucepan, and simmer gently for 3 or 4 hours.


                    Brown Onion Soup. Time—1½ hour.

3 onions, 1 oz. dripping, 1 teaspoonful flour, 1½ pint water or
pot-liquor; pepper, salt and soy to taste.

Skin the onions, cut them into small dice, heat the dripping, and throw
in the onions, shaking them about over the fire till they are golden
brown (they must be coloured very slowly or some pieces will get too
dark). When they are brown stir in the flour carefully, and add the
water or pot-liquor. Simmer for an hour, then rub through a sieve,
return to the saucepan, add a little soy, pepper and salt to taste, and
boil for 3 minutes before serving.

If these directions are carefully followed this soup is equal to one
made from good stock.


                       Carrot Soup. Time—1½ hour.

1 quart water or pot-liquor, 1½ lb. carrots, 4 onions, 2 oz. dripping;
salt and pepper to taste.

Prepare the vegetables, slice them, then fry them in the dripping. Add
the water or pot-liquor, salt and pepper. Boil till the vegetables are
tender, then pulp through a sieve into a basin. Heat again and serve
with fried bread.


                    Lentil Soup. Time—3 or 4 hours.

5 pints water, 1 pint red lentils, 1 onion, 3 sticks of celery or some
celery seed, 1 oz. dripping; pepper and salt to taste.

The lentils must be soaked all night in cold water. Melt the dripping in
a saucepan, fry the lentils, sliced onion, and celery cut in small
pieces. Stir over the fire for 5 minutes. Then add the water and boil
gently, stirring occasionally, till the lentils are quite soft. Pass all
through a sieve, return to the saucepan, add the pepper and salt, and
heat again.


                        Pea Soup. Time—2½ hours.

1 pint split peas, 2 onions, 1 carrot, 1 turnip, 3 sticks celery, 2
quarts water or pot-liquor; salt and pepper to taste. Bones or trimmings
from meat are a great improvement.

Soak the peas over-night; next morning put them on in the cold water or
pot-liquor. Bring to the boil, and then add the prepared vegetables,
bones, and seasoning. Skim well, and boil for 1½ hour, stirring
occasionally. Remove the bones, and pulp the soup through a sieve. Heat
it again, and serve with dried mint and fried bread.


                      Spinach Soup. Time—2 hours.

3 lbs. spinach, 1 quart water or stock, salt and pepper to taste, 1
tablespoonful flour.

Wash the spinach in several waters, strip off the leaves and place them
in a saucepan of cold water with a little salt, and boil till tender
(about ½ hour). Pulp through a hair sieve with the water in which it was
boiled; boil it up again in a clean stew-pan, thicken carefully with the
flour, cook for 10 minutes, and serve with poached eggs.


                     Vegetable Soup. Time—1½ hour.

1 quart water or pot-liquor, 2 carrots, 2 turnips, 2 potatoes, 2 onions,
3 sticks celery, a few sifted herbs, 1 oz. dripping, 1 tablespoonful
flour, 1 teaspoonful mustard; salt and pepper to taste.

Prepare the vegetables, cut them into slices, fry them in the dripping,
add the water or pot-liquor, the salt, pepper, and herbs. Boil till
quite tender, mix the flour and mustard to a cream with the cold water,
and add to the soup. Simmer for half an hour longer and then serve.

------------------------------------------------------------------------




                                 FISH.


Fresh fish may be known by its stiffness, firmness, bright eyes, and
bright red gills.

The cheaper kinds of fish, such as herrings, mackerel, haddocks, and
plaice, contain more nourishment than most of the more expensive kinds.
All fish must be thoroughly cleansed in salt and water, two waters at
least being allowed. It must then be very carefully dried in a coarse
cloth kept specially for this purpose.


                             To Bake Fish.

Clean and dry the fish very thoroughly, put it on a baking tin, greased
with a little oil or butter, sprinkling pepper and salt over it. Cover
with a well-greased sheet of paper, bake from 10 minutes to ½ an hour,
according to the size of the fish. Remove the paper, and serve the fish
with chopped parsley and the strained liquor from the tin.


                             To Boil Fish.

When the fish is thoroughly cleaned, put it on a strainer or dish, place
it in a saucepan with boiling water sufficient to cover it, some salt
and a tablespoonful of vinegar. Simmer gently till the skin begins to
crack.

Some of the liquor in which the fish was boiled can be used for making a
sauce.


                             To Broil Fish.

Clean and dry the fish thoroughly, split it open, flour it, sprinkle
with chopped parsley, pepper, and salt. Grease a gridiron with oil or
butter, and broil the fish over or in front of a very clear fire from 10
to 15 minutes. Sprinkle with small pieces of butter before serving.
Before broiling mackerel or herrings lay them in a mixture of salad oil
and tarragon vinegar for an hour.


                            Hints on Frying.

This method of cooking fish requires the utmost care. It is most
important that the fish should be very carefully dried, and that the oil
should be at the right temperature. To test this throw in a small piece
of bread, and if it brown in less than a minute the oil has reached the
correct heat. When the oil is perfectly still, and a blue smoke rises,
the temperature may also be considered right. The fish must be well
covered in oil, and the pieces must not come in contact with one
another.


                              To Fry Fish.

Clean the fish, then cut it as required, and dry it very thoroughly.
Beat up an egg, mix some flour, pepper and salt on a plate, dip the fish
first into this seasoning, then into the egg, and when the oil has
reached the right temperature, fry the fish a golden brown. Place it on
soft paper on a basket lid to drain. When the oil has cooled, strain it,
pour it into a jar, cover it and it will be ready for use another time.
It can be used again for _fish_ only.

To economise the eggs mix a little water with them.

To utilise any scraps of fried fish, heat them in melted butter (page
40), flavoured to taste.


                             To Steam Fish.

Fish should rather be steamed than boiled, for though more time is
required the result is more satisfactory. If a fish-kettle is not to
hand, place a pie-dish upside down in a large saucepan, and put the fish
on it. Let boiling water always reach half way up the dish, so that the
fish cooks in the steam. Add more boiling water when required.


                      Anchovy Butter. Time—½ hour.

6 large anchovies, 1 hard boiled egg, 2 oz. butter, a little pepper.

Pound all together and pass through a sieve.


                       Savoury Cod. Time—½ hour.

1 or more lbs. of fresh cod, 1 tablespoonful vinegar, 1 dessertspoonful
flour, 1 teaspoonful chopped parsley, ½ teaspoonful salt, ¼ teaspoonful
pepper, 1 oz. butter, 1 egg.

Clean the fish and dry it, then cut it into nice sized pieces. Boil as
directed (page 10), then cover and keep hot. Put the flour into a basin,
and add pepper, salt, and butter (melted); mix well, and make into a
paste with the vinegar. Stir this into ½ pint of the liquor in which the
fish has been boiled, and cook 3 minutes, stirring continually. While
this sauce cools beat up an egg; then stir it carefully into the sauce,
add the chopped parsley, and pour it over the fish. If preferred the egg
may be boiled hard and chopped.


                      Baked Haddock. Time—¾ hour.

1 haddock, 2 tablespoonfuls bread crumbs, 1 dessertspoonful chopped
parsley, 1 teaspoonful chopped herbs, 1 egg (well beaten); 2 oz. butter
or 1 tablespoonful oil; pepper and salt to taste.

Wash and dry the fish well. Mix nearly all the bread crumbs with the
herbs, parsley, pepper, salt, half the egg, and ½ oz. of butter. Stuff
the stomach of the fish with this mixture, and sew or skewer it up. Egg
and bread-crumb the fish, place it on a greased tin in the shape of an
S, with the oil and pieces of butter; bake for half-an-hour, basting it
frequently. Take out the cotton with which the fish was sewn before
serving.


                    Dried Haddock. Time—20 minutes.

Place the dried haddock in a frying-pan and cover with cold water. Bring
to the boil, then take out the haddock, place it on a dish in the oven,
with bits of butter over it, for 5 minutes, and then serve.


                Baked Plaice and Tomatoes. Time—¾ hour.

1 plaice, 1 onion, 4 tomatoes, 2 tablespoonfuls oil, 1 lb. potatoes,
pepper and salt to taste, the juice of a lemon, chopped parsley.

Slice the onion and tomatoes, heat them in a tin with the oil, salt and
pepper. Wash the plaice and dry it well, put it in the tin, season it,
dredge it with flour, and baste it with the oil. Parboil the potatoes
and put them round the plaice to get brown. When dishing up, squeeze the
lemon-juice over the plaice and sprinkle with the chopped parsley.

Haddocks may also be cooked in this way.


                     Soused Herrings. Time—½ hour.

3 herrings, ½ pint vinegar, 2 bay-leaves, whole peppers, salt, and
cloves to taste.

Split and halve the herrings, roll and tie them up. Place them in a
pie-dish, half cover with vinegar, add whole peppers, salt, cloves, and
bay-leaves, and bake in a slow oven until they feel soft (about 20
minutes).

put it on to boil. Place the fillets folded loosely on a greased tin,
and sprinkle them with lemon-juice, pepper and salt. Cover with a
greased paper, and cook in a moderate oven, about 6 minutes. Melt the
butter in a clean saucepan, drop the flour in gradually, and mix well.
Add the fish liquor and boil 10 minutes. Then add salt, pepper, cream,
lemon-juice, and parsley. Arrange the fillets on a dish with the sauce
poured over them.


                      Sole au Gratin. Time—½ hour.

lemon, 1 oz. butter, raspings (see page x.); salt and pepper to taste.

Skin the sole, cut off the fins and nick it on both sides with a knife,
dry it well. Chop the shalot, mushrooms and parsley, mix them together,
and sprinkle half of them on to a dish. Lay the sole on this seasoning,
and sprinkle the rest of it over the sole. Squeeze lemon-juice over,
sprinkle with salt, pepper and raspings. Put little bits of butter on
the fish, bake in a moderate oven for 10 minutes.


                Soles Stewed with Tomatoes. Time—¾ hour.

A pair of soles, 1 small onion, 2 tablespoonfuls oil, or 2 oz. butter, 4
tomatoes, the juice of 1 lemon, pepper, salt, a little cayenne and

tablespoonful vinegar, two-pennyworth ginger-bread, one-pennyworth
golden syrup, 1 lemon; pepper and salt to taste.

Peel and cut up the onion, brown it in the oil, put it in the stew-pan
with the fish and water, and cook for half an hour. Soak the
ginger-bread in the golden syrup and vinegar; when soft, beat it up and
add the lemon-juice, pepper and salt. Ten minutes before the fish is
ready, pour this sauce on to it, and tilt the stew-pan well backwards
and forwards. Serve cold.


              White Stewed Fish with Balls. Time—1½ hour.

3 lbs. fish, 2 small onions, 2 tablespoonfuls sweet oil, 1 pint cold
water, nutmeg and ginger, pepper and salt to taste, a pinch of powdered
saffron, juice of 3 lemons, 1 tablespoonful flour, 2 eggs; (_for the
balls_) a piece of cod’s-liver, chopped parsley, bread-crumbs.

Chop the onions, stew till tender in the oil in a stew-pan, take out
one-third for balls, add the fish and water, season with salt, pepper,
ginger and nutmeg. When the liquor boils, place the balls (see below) on
the top of the fish and cook ¼ hour, then draw the stew-pan to the side
of the fire. Mix the flour to a smooth paste with a little cold water in
a separate basin, add the lemon-juice, 1 whole egg and 1 yolk beaten,
the saffron, and mix all well together. Take a pint of the fish-liquor
from the stew-pan, add this gradually to the contents of the basin,
stirring all the time. When thoroughly mixed, pour it back into the stew
pan, from which must previously be taken some of the fish-liquor, if
there seem too much. Tilt the stew-pan backwards and forwards till the
sauce has thickened sufficiently. Serve hot or cold, with the sauce
poured over the fish and balls, and garnish with parsley and slices of
lemon.

_To make the balls_: Chop the cod’s-liver very fine; add the remainder
of the onion chopped fine, parsley, white of egg beaten, pepper, salt,
nutmeg, ginger, and sufficient bread-crumbs to make them the right
stiffness.

                                 MEAT.


Good meat should be firm to the touch, adhere closely to the bones, be
streaked with fat, and should have a slight but not unpleasant odour.

Meat becomes much more tender if it can be hung a day or two before it
is cooked.


                             To Bake Meat.

Baking closely resembles roasting. It is more economical, as the joint
loses less weight, and if carefully attended to cannot be distinguished
from roast meat. A double tin which holds hot water should be used, so
that the steam from the water may prevent the dripping from burning.
Place the meat on a trivet in the tin, flour the meat, sprinkle it with
salt, put it in the hottest part of the oven for the first few minutes,
then remove it to a cooler part, baste well, and turn it over
occasionally. (For time and gravy see Roast Meat.)


                             To Boil Meat.

Weigh the meat, allow twenty minutes to each pound, and twenty minutes
extra for dishing up. Put the meat into boiling water, boil five
minutes, then draw the saucepan to the side of the fire, and simmer;
keep the meat well covered with water; serve with a teacupful of its own
liquor. Never throw away the liquor in which meat has been boiled; it
makes excellent soup.


                             To Roast Meat.

Have a bright and clear fire; weigh the meat, allow twenty minutes to
each pound, and twenty minutes extra for dishing up; flour the joint
well, and sprinkle it with salt; let it roast quickly the first ten
minutes, then put it farther from the fire, and let it cook more slowly,
basting often; flour occasionally. When dishing up, pour the dripping
out of the pan, and set it aside. Add one pint or more of boiling water
to the brown lumps under the dripping, and put it in the hottest part of
the oven. Pour this gravy over the meat and serve.


                     Beef à la Mode. Time—5 hours.

3 lbs. lean brisket, 1 quart water, ½ gill vinegar, 4 Spanish onions, 2
oz. mustard seed, 1 oz. long pepper, ½ teaspoonful ground ginger; salt
to taste; a thickening of flour, sugar, and browning.

Put the beef on in cold water, bring it to the boil, then simmer for
three hours, reducing the water to one pint. Add the vinegar, onions,
and other ingredients. Stew in the oven (if possible) for two hours, but
if the saucepan is too large for the oven, let the meat continue to
simmer on the stove. Half an hour before serving, thicken the gravy with
flour, sugar, and browning (see page x.).


                              Smoked Beef.

Soak over-night in cold water; next morning place it in cold water, and
simmer till quite tender, reckoning ½ hour to the pound.


                      Beef Steak. Time—20 minutes.

Heat the gridiron, put in the steak, turn the gridiron four times at
intervals of 2 minutes, then eight times at intervals of 1 minute.
Sprinkle with pepper and salt, and serve on a hot plate.

_Chops_ are done in the same way, turning the gridiron twice at
intervals of 2 minutes, and six times at intervals of 1 minute.

To make steak tender: beat it well, and rub into it a small pinch of
carbonate of soda.


                     Beef Steak Pie. Time—2½ hours.

1½ lb. beef steak, ¾ lb. flour, ¼ lb. clarified dripping, 1 teaspoonful
salt, ½ teaspoonful pepper.

Beat the steak well, cut it up into neat pieces. Mix 1 tablespoonful
flour, salt, and pepper on a plate, and dip each piece of meat into the
mixture. Put the pieces in a stew-pan, cover with cold water, and simmer
gently about ½ hour, then turn the meat and gravy into a pie-dish.

Put the flour into a large basin with half a saltspoonful of salt, rub
the dripping into it, and add by degrees enough cold water to make a
stiff paste. Flour a board, roll the pastry out rather larger than the
pie-dish, about one-third of an inch thick, cut a strip off, wet the
edge of the dish, place the strip round it, wet the strip, and press the
rest of the pastry on to it, trimming off the rough edges with a sharp
knife. Make a hole in the top of the pie to allow the steam to escape
whilst baking; ornament the top and edges and brush over with beaten
egg. Bake for ¾ hour, putting it into the hottest part of the oven for a
few minutes, then remove it to a cooler part.


                   Beef Steak Pudding. Time—3½ hours.

1 lb. beef, 4 oz. suet, ¾ lb. flour, 1½ gill water, 1 teaspoonful
baking-powder; salt and pepper to taste.

Put on a large saucepan of water to boil. Mix on a plate 1
dessertspoonful of flour, some pepper and salt. Beat the steak well, cut
it into slices, dip each piece in the mixture, and roll it up. Put the
flour, baking-powder, salt, and suet chopped fine, into a basin, and mix
to a stiff paste with cold water. Cut off one-third for the top. Grease
a basin well, line it with the paste, put in the meat with a little
water or gravy, wet the edges, press the top on. Tie a pudding cloth,
dipped in boiling water and dredged with flour, over the basin, place it
in the saucepan of boiling water, and boil 2½ hours.


          Stewed Shin of Beef (with Dumplings). Time—2½ hours.

1 lb. shin of beef, 2 onions, 2 carrots, 2 turnips, 2 tablespoonfuls
flour, 2 oz. dripping or suet; pepper and salt to taste.

Prepare the carrots and turnips and boil them quickly 20 minutes in 1
quart of water. Cut the meat into pieces, fry a light brown in the
dripping, then place the pieces in a saucepan. Peel and slice the
onions, fry them in the same dripping, then stir in carefully 2
tablespoonfuls of flour to brown. Add the carrots and turnips to the
meat, pour the water in which they were boiled into the frying-pan to
brown; then add it with the onions, pepper and salt to the meat, etc,
and stew slowly 1½ hour.

_Dumplings._—½ lb. flour, 2 oz. dripping, 1 teaspoonful baking-powder, 1
teaspoonful salt.

Shred the fat fine and rub it into the flour with the baking-powder and
salt. Mix with lukewarm water to a stiff paste. Cut into eight pieces,
and roll lightly into dumplings on a floured board. Throw them into a
saucepan of boiling water, and boil till they rise to the surface (20
minutes). Add them to the stew 10 minutes before serving.


              Beef Stewed with French Beans. Time—3 hours.

5 lbs. lean brisket, 2 lbs. French beans, 4 good-sized onions, 1 pint
water, 1 gill vinegar, 1 tablespoonful flour, 2 tablespoonfuls dark
moist sugar; pepper and salt to taste.

Stew the beef 3 hours in the water. String the beans, cut them in
halves, peel and cut up the onions, and add all to the beef at the end
of the first hour. About 10 minutes before serving skim off all the fat;
mix smoothly in a separate basin the flour, sugar, vinegar, pepper and
salt, and add the mixture to the stew.


             Beef Stewed with Haricot Beans. Time—5 hours.

3 lbs. lean brisket, 1 onion, 1 tablespoonful moist sugar, 1 oz.
dripping, ¾ pint haricot beans, ¾ pint cold water, 1 tablespoonful
flour; pepper, salt and ground ginger to taste.

The beans must be put in soak over-night.

Chop the onion fine, fry in the dripping, add the flour, seasoning,
sugar, beans and water. Stew the meat and vegetables, etc., very gently
4 or 5 hours.


                      Brain Fritters. Time—½ hour.

1 set brains, 1 teaspoonful chopped parsley, 2 eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls
bread-crumbs; pepper and salt.

Wash the brains in vinegar and water, then put them into boiling water
and boil for 10 minutes. Drain them, chop them, and put them into a
basin with 1 teaspoonful chopped parsley, pepper, salt and 1 egg. Add
sufficient bread-crumbs to make them into a stiff paste (not exceeding
two tablespoonfuls). Form into flat, round cakes, dip into egg and
bread-crumbs and fry.


                     Brazilian Stew. Time—3 hours.

1 lb. beef, 1 carrot, 1 turnip, herbs, pepper and salt to taste, ½ gill
vinegar.

Cut the meat into neat pieces, dip each piece in the vinegar, and pack
closely in a saucepan. Sprinkle with pepper and salt. Cut the vegetables
into slices, and put them with the herbs into the saucepan. Close the
lid, and steam 2½ hours, stirring occasionally.


                      Braised Beef. Time—3 hours.

5 lbs. topside, ½ lb. smoked beef, 3 oz. dripping, 1 medium-sized onion,
1 small carrot, 1 turnip, 3 to 4 sticks celery, 1 pint water, a few
whole peppers and allspice, 1 tablespoonful vinegar, 1 tablespoonful
flour; salt to taste.

Melt the dripping, cut up the smoked beef into thin wedge-like strips
and insert them into the meat with a knife. Brown both sides of the meat
in the dripping, add the vegetables, seasoning and water, and let all
stew _very_ slowly for 2½ hours. ¼ hour before serving, take out the
meat, keep it hot; mix the flour, vinegar and 1 tablespoonful water to a
paste, pour it into the stew-pan and thicken it, strain gravy over meat
and serve.


                          To Clarify Dripping.

Pour the dripping from the pan into a basin of cold water. When cool
lift off the cake of clarified dripping, scrape away the sediment from
the bottom, and wipe dry.


                            To Clarify Fat.

Cut up any scraps of cooked or uncooked fat into small pieces, place in
a saucepan, add just sufficient cold water to cover them, stir often,
and simmer with the lid off till nothing is left of the pieces of fat
but brownish scraps. Strain into a basin, and when cold, a hard white
cake will be formed, which will keep good some time. This fat makes
excellent pastry, and can be used for frying.


                       Irish Stew. Time—2 hours.

1½ lb. breast or scrag of mutton, 2 lbs. of potatoes, 1 pint water, 3
onions, 1 tablespoonful flour, 1 teaspoonful salt, ½ teaspoonful pepper.

                              VEGETABLES.


                     Hints on Preparing Vegetables.

1. Vegetables keep best on a stone floor.

2. All green vegetables should be laid in cold salt and water for 1 hour
before they are cooked. This draws out all the insects they contain.
Carrots should be scraped, then cut up and thrown into cold water till
they are cooked. Turnips must be peeled thickly, then cut up and thrown
into cold water till they are cooked. Onions must be peeled, then, as a
rule, sliced or chopped.

3. Green vegetables should be thrown into boiling water with a little
salt and small piece of soda, boiled quickly for a few minutes and then
simmered until tender.

4. A crust of bread should be boiled with cabbages, greens, etc. This
takes off the disagreeable smell.

5. Vegetables must never be left over-night in saucepans, for a poison
would be produced.

6. All the waste part of vegetables should be dried under the grate,
then burnt at once, _never thrown into the dust-bin_. By this means all
unwholesome smells are avoided.


                     Baked Beetroot. Time—3 hours.

Boil a large beetroot about 2 hours, be careful not to pierce it. When
cold mash it very smooth, add a little dripping, pepper, salt and stock.
Place in a greased basin and bake for 1 hour.


                       Broad Beans. Time—¾ hour.

Shell, wash and drain them. Throw into cold water with a little salt and
a bunch of parsley. Boil until soft (20 to 30 minutes), then drain them.
Serve either with melted butter or gravy.


                       French Beans. Time—¾ hour.

String the beans, cut each slantwise into 2 or 3 pieces, wash them well
in cold salt and water, drain them, and throw them into boiling water
with a little salt and a small piece of soda in it. Let them boil very
fast with the lid off, until tender. Drain the water off and serve.

_French beans, à la maître d’hôtel_ are boiled as above, then rinsed in
cold water, dried and put into a stew-pan on the fire with a little
dripping, chopped parsley, pepper, salt, nutmeg and lemon-juice, till
thoroughly heated through.


                      Haricot Beans. Time—6 hours.

1 pint haricot beans, 1 tablespoonful vinegar, 1 teaspoonful brown
sugar; pepper and salt to taste.

Soak the beans over-night. Next day boil them for 5 or 6 hours in plenty
of water. One hour before serving, mix the vinegar, sugar, pepper and
salt well together, pour away some of the water from the beans, and add
the mixture to them.


       Cabbages, Cauliflowers, Greens, and Savoys. Time—1½ hour.

Cut off the faded outside leaves and hard part of the stalk, and wash
the vegetables well. Cook in plenty of boiling water, with a
tablespoonful of salt to every half-gallon. If the water is very hard,
add sufficient carbonate of soda to cover a threepenny piece. Boil with
the lid off till the stalk is soft.


                      Stewed Carrots. Time—½ hour.

Scrape carrots carefully and cut in thick pieces. Place them in
sufficient water to cover them and stew till tender. Then evaporate
water till only half remains. Add a little dripping, flour and pepper
and toss carrots gently in pan till they are coated with their own
juice, and serve.


                      Stewed Celery. Time—¾ hour.

Boil some heads of celery, cut into pieces about 2 inches long, in some
good stock, add salt, pepper, and a little lemon-juice. Thicken the
stock with flour and serve.


                         Colcannon. Time—¼ hour

Equal quantities of cooked cabbage and potatoes, chopped, mixed
together, seasoned with pepper and salt, and fried in a little dripping.


               Boiled Green Peas. Time—20 to 30 minutes.

Shell and pick them over, wash them in cold water, drain them. Throw
them into boiling water, add a teaspoonful brown sugar, a little mint
and salt. Boil until quite tender, drain off the water, and serve in a
hot dish with the mint.


                    Dried Green Peas. Time—4 hours.

Soak over-night; next morning put them in a jar in the oven with plenty
of water, salt and a spoonful of sugar. Stew gently for 3 or 4 hours,
until quite tender. A pinch of carbonate of soda may be added to the
water, to improve the colour of the peas. Serve either with gravy, or a
little butter, pepper and salt.


                   Jerusalem Artichokes. Time—½ hour.

Peel and wash them, place in cold water with a little salt and
lemon-juice, and cook till soft. They can be served either with gravy or
butter sauce.


                     Baked Potatoes. Time—1½ hour.

Choose potatoes of equal size. Brush them very clean, drop them into a
basin of cold salt and water, then dry them. Place them on a baking
sheet, and bake in a moderate oven. When a fork will pierce them easily
they are baked. The skins should never be eaten.

_Another way._—Brush the potatoes, peel them very thin, parboil them,
then brown them under the meat.


                     Boiled Potatoes. Time—¾ hour.

Potatoes should be well brushed, dropped into a basin of cold salt and
water, and when a saucepan of water boils they should be placed in it.
When a fork will pierce them easily, they are done. The water must then
be strained off, the saucepan drawn to the side of the fire, a clean
cloth folded over the top of the saucepan, and the lid pressed down on
to it. This dries the potatoes, and makes them a good colour. They
should be held in a cloth and peeled, then re-heated for a minute. _New
potatoes_, if well brushed or scraped, do not require peeling.


                      Fried Potatoes. Time—½ hour.

Brush the potatoes, peel them very thin, slice them, dry them, and fry
them a light brown in hot fat.


                     Mashed Potatoes. Time—1 hour.

Boil the potatoes, mash them through a sieve, or beat them with a fork.
Add a little dripping or butter, and brown in the oven.


                       Boiled Rice. Time—½ hour.

½ lb. rice, ¼ teaspoonful salt, 4 quarts boiling water.

Well wash the rice in cold water, then put it into the boiling water
with the salt, and let it boil fast 15 to 20 minutes. When it is quite
tender, strain it into a colander, turn the cold water tap on to it for
2 or 3 seconds. Then place it in a dry saucepan by the side of the fire,
with the lid half on, to dry and get hot. Shake it occasionally to
prevent it burning, and serve.


                      Spanish Onions. Time—¾ hour.

Wash them, throw them into boiling water _with their skins on_, and boil
until tender. Remove the outer skin. Serve with pepper, salt, gravy or
butter.


                  Turnip Tops or Spinach. Time—¾ hour.

2 lbs. turnip tops, 2 oz. clarified fat, pepper and salt.

Wash well in several waters, strip off the leaves and place them in a
saucepan of cold water with a little salt, and boil till tender. Strain
and squeeze them as much as possible, chop very fine on a board, put
back in the saucepan with the dripping, pepper and salt, and mix well
till thoroughly hot. Serve decorated with hard-boiled eggs cut in
quarters.


                  Fried Vegetable Marrow. Time—¾ hour.

1 vegetable marrow, 2 oz. flour, ½ gill tepid water, 1 dessertspoonful
salad oil, salt, white of 1 egg.

Put the flour into a basin with a pinch of salt, add the oil and tepid
water gradually, then the white of egg, well beaten. Peel the marrow,
put it into boiling water, and boil until tender. Cut it into slices,
remove the seeds, dip each piece in the batter, and fry in hot fat or
oil a golden brown.

                    PIES, PUDDINGS AND SWEET DISHES.


                        Hints on Making Pastry.

1. Have everything particularly clean and dry.

2. Pass the flour through a wire sieve, and rub in the butter or fat
with the _tips_ of the fingers only.

3. Keep everything cool. Always mix the paste with _cold_ water. To
prevent hot hands wash them in _hot_ water.

4. Roll out a short crust _once_ only. If baking-powder be used, make
and bake the pastry as quickly as possible.

5. Test the oven by placing a small piece of bread on the shelf. If it
brown in half a minute the heat is correct.

6. Bake in the hottest part of the oven for the first five minutes, then
remove to a cooler part.

7. Warm jam separately, and place it in the tart at the last minute. To
keep the shape of the tart, place a piece of bread in the centre whilst
baking.


                         Pastry.—Short Crusts.

1 lb. flour to ¾ lb. butter or fat, _or_ 1 lb. flour to ½ lb. butter or
fat, and the yolk of one egg; _or_ 1 lb. flour to ½ lb. butter or fat,
and 1 teaspoonful baking-powder; _or_ 1 lb. flour to ¼ lb. butter or
fat, and 1 teaspoonful baking-powder.


                             Flaky Pastry.

½ lb. flour, ¼ lb. butter or fat.

Divide the fat into three equal portions, rub one part into the flour in
the usual way, add a pinch of salt and mix to a stiff paste with cold
water. Roll out into a long narrow strip, rolling backwards and forwards
_only_. Spread the second portion of fat evenly over the paste, fold
into three and turn with the rough edges towards you. Roll out again and
proceed in the same way. Fold over and roll to required shape.


                           Rough Puff Paste.

1 lb. flour to ¾ lb. butter or fat, _or_ 1 lb. flour to ½ lb. butter or
fat.

Break the butter or fat into the flour in lumps, and mix to a paste with
a little cold water. Roll out, fold in three, turn the rough edges
towards you, and roll out again. Do this four or six times till the
paste is no longer streaky.


                           To Bake Puddings.

All puddings containing starch, such as rice, sago, macaroni, etc., must
be baked slowly in a moderate oven, so that the starch globules may have
time to swell, burst, and absorb the milk. Custards must also bake very
slowly. Puddings containing flour must bake longer than those made with
bread, etc.


                           To Boil Puddings.

1. Always place these puddings in boiling water; keep them well covered,
and on the boil, adding more boiling water as required.

2. All puddings containing flour must boil longer than those made with
bread, etc.

3. Puddings boiled in basins must boil longer than those put only in
cloths.

4. The basin must always be quite full, and must be tied up in a cloth
which has been dredged with flour.


                           To Steam Puddings.

1. Puddings cooked in this way are lighter than those that are boiled,
but take longer to cook.

2. The water in the saucepan must only reach half-way up the basin, and
must _simmer_ all the time. More boiling water must be added when
required.

3. The basin need not be quite full.


                      Almond Pudding. Time—1 hour.

8 eggs, 8 oz. castor sugar, 8 oz. ground almonds.

Beat the yolks and whites separately—the whites to a stiff froth—then
whisk them together, and stir in gradually the sugar, and ground
almonds. Beat well for 20 minutes, then pour the mixture into
well-greased shallow dishes, and bake in a moderate oven. If a knife
when inserted come out clean, the puddings are done.

then the remainder of the fruit, and a little water. Rub the fat into
the flour, add the baking-powder, salt, and sufficient water to make a
stiff paste. Roll this out to the shape of the dish, but larger; cut off
a strip, wet the edge of the dish, put the strip round it, wet the
strip, and press the rest of the pastry on to it. Trim neatly, ornament,

------------------------------------------------------------------------




                           BREAKFAST DISHES.

the flower upwards, and press it into shape. Melt the butter, mix the
flour in smoothly, add the water and stir well over the fire for 5
minutes, then add the cream or milk, the seasoning and half the grated
cheese, and heat the sauce. Pour the sauce over the cauliflower, and
sprinkle the rest of the cheese over the top. Brown it in a quick oven.


                        Chocolate. Time—½ hour.

4 oz. chocolate, 2 gills water, 1 pint milk.

Grate the chocolate, put it in the saucepan with the water, set it on
the fire and stir with a wooden spoon till the mixture becomes rather
thick, then work it very quickly for a few minutes with the spoon. Stir
in the boiling milk gradually and serve.


                        Cocoa. Time—10 minutes.

2 teaspoonfuls cocoa, 1 teaspoonful cold water or milk, 1 teacupful

                       Cocoa Nibs. Time—6 hours.

½ lb. cocoa nibs, 2 quarts water.

Crush the nibs with a rolling pin, then place them in a saucepan with
the cold water, and bring to the boil. Draw to the side of the fire, and
simmer gently about 5 hours, occasionally skimming off the oil which
rises to the top. Strain, add about an equal quantity of milk, re-heat
and serve.


                            Coffee in a Jug.

1 pint boiling water, 2 heaped tablespoonfuls ground coffee.

Scald a jug, which has a lid, with hot water, then put in the coffee,
and pour the boiling water on to it. Put on the lid, and let the coffee
draw 5 minutes close to the fire. Clear it, by pouring a little into a
cup and pouring it back 3 times, or by adding a small teacupful of cold
water. Then let the jug stand 10 minutes in a hot place, where it will
almost simmer. Serve with boiling milk, and sugar to taste.


                        Coffee in a Coffee-Pot.

Scald the coffee-pot with hot water. Put the coffee in above the
strainer, pour the boiling water over it very gradually, and while it is
running through, place the pot where it will keep very hot. As soon as
all the water has run through, serve with boiling milk, and sugar to
taste. Use 1 heaped teaspoonful for each person and 1 extra.


                     Coddled Eggs. Time—5 minutes.

Eggs should not be _boiled_, because this process hardens the outside
quickly, before cooking the yolk thoroughly. Carefully put the egg into
boiling water with a spoon, place the saucepan near the fire, where the
water cannot boil, but is near to boiling point. Take it out after 5
minutes.

_Hard-boiled Eggs_: Place the eggs in a saucepan in cold water, bring to
the boil and let them cook 12 minutes; then put them immediately into a
basin of cold water to keep them a good colour.


                      Fried Eggs. Time—10 minutes.

2 eggs, 1 oz. butter; pepper and salt to taste.

Make the butter hot in a frying-pan, break the eggs into a cup and slip
them carefully in without breaking the yolks, and fry 3 or 4 minutes.
Take them out with a slice and serve hot.


                     Poached Eggs. Time—10 minutes.

1 egg, buttered toast, salt, ½ pint water, 1 teaspoonful vinegar.

Put the water with salt and vinegar into a shallow saucepan where the
water cannot boil, but is near to boiling point. Break the egg into a
cup, and slip it gently into the water. Let it remain till the white is
set. Take it out carefully with a small slice, trim the edges, and place
it on a piece of buttered toast, with pepper and salt to taste.


                       Savoury Eggs. Time—½ hour.

of cayenne. Fill the white halves with this paste, cut off the ends,
stand each half on a round of bread-and-butter, and ornament with cress
or parsley.

_Another Way._—4 hard-boiled eggs, 1 oz. butter, 1 teaspoonful chopped
tarragon, beetroot cut into fancy shapes, mustard and cress.

Halve the eggs, take out the yolks, mix these smoothly with the butter
and tarragon. Fill the whites with the mixture, ornament with beetroot,
and arrange on a dish with the cress round.


                   Stewed Peas and Eggs. Time—¾ hour.

¼ peck peas, 1 dessertspoonful oil, 1 small onion, 1 teacupful boiling
water, 2 lumps sugar, a little fresh mint, 3 eggs; salt and pepper to
taste.

Fry the onion in the oil, with some salt and pepper. Pick the peas over
carefully, wash and drain them, put them in the saucepan with the oil
and onion, add the water, sugar and mint. Cook till the peas are tender
(about ½ hour), then break the eggs into a cup, and slip them carefully
on to the peas. Cook till they are set, and dish up.


               Stirred or Buttered Eggs. Time—10 minutes.

2 eggs, 1 oz. butter, salt and pepper to taste, 2 slices hot buttered
toast.

Break the eggs into a small stew-pan, add the salt, pepper and butter.
Put the stew-pan over a moderate fire, and stir with a wooden spoon,
keeping every particle in motion, until the whole has become a smooth
and delicate thickish paste. Pour the eggs on to the toast, and serve at
once.


                         Hominy. Time—3¼ hours.

The day before it is required, place half a teacupful of hominy in a
basin with 1 pint of water and a good pinch of salt. Put it in a
moderate oven to soak for 3 hours, adding more water if required. Next
morning warm it up with about ½ pint of milk, and add sugar to taste.

flour; salt and a little cayenne pepper to taste.

Put the macaroni with one teaspoonful salt into boiling water and boil
till tender, about 20 minutes; take it out, cut it up into lengths of
about 2 inches, and throw the water away; melt the butter, stir in the
flour, add the milk and seasoning. Boil well, put in the macaroni, let
it cool a little, then add half the cheese. Place in a pie-dish,
sprinkle with the rest of the cheese and bake 10 minutes.


                        Mushrooms. Time—¾ hour.

½ lb. mushrooms, ½ pint milk, 1 oz. butter, 1 tablespoonful flour, 1
tablespoonful mushroom ketchup, pepper and salt to taste.

Wash and peel the mushrooms and cut them into pieces. Stew them about ½
hour in the milk, add the flour, the butter melted, ketchup, pepper and
salt, and serve on toast.

_Another Way._—Peel the mushrooms, put them in a pie-dish with 1 oz.
butter, pepper and salt, and bake about 20 minutes.


                                Risotto.

1½ pint water, ¼ lb. Carolina rice, 1 gill tomato purée, 2 oz. grated
cheese, salt and pepper to taste, 1 oz. butter.

Bring the water to the boil in a large stew-pan, shower the rice in,

oz. of the cheese, season with pepper and salt, and serve very hot with
cheese sprinkled over the top.


                       Porridge. Time—45 minutes.

2 oz. coarse oatmeal, ¼ teaspoonful salt, 1 pint water, milk and sugar.

When the water boils fast, add the salt, then sprinkle in the oatmeal.
Boil gently 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Then let it simmer 30
minutes more, stirring often. Turn into hot soup-plates, and serve with
milk and sugar, or with golden syrup.


                        Salmagundy. Time—½ hour.

1 Dutch herring, 1 onion, ½ pint vinegar, a little allspice, ginger, and
pepper.

Wash the herring, remove the flesh from the bones, lay it in a dish, and
put a few slices of onion on it. Boil the vinegar with the spice, and
when cold, pour it over the herring.


                    Savoury Omelet. Time—10 minutes.

2 eggs, 1 oz. butter, a pinch of salt and of pepper, ½ teaspoonful
chopped parsley, ½ teaspoonful chopped herbs.

Melt the butter in a small frying-pan, beat up the eggs in a basin with
the parsley, herbs, pepper and salt. Pour the mixture into the pan,
allow it to cook for 2 or 3 minutes; double it and shake it off on to a
hot plate. While the omelet is cooking, pass a knife round the edges of
it, and shake the pan to keep it from sticking.


                                  Tea.

Scald the tea-pot. Allow 1 teaspoonful of tea to each person, and one
extra. When the water boils, pour off the water with which the pot was
scalded, put in the tea, and pour boiling water over it. Let it draw 3
minutes. Tea should never be allowed to remain on the leaves. If not
drunk as soon as it is drawn, it should be poured off into another hot
tea-pot, or into a hot jug, which should stand in hot water.


                                 Toast.

Cut a slice of stale bread about ⅓ inch thick. Dry each side ½ minute
before the fire, then toast quickly before a clear fire. Put small
pieces of butter all over the slice of toast, and when these are melted,
smooth them over it. This will leave the toast deliciously crisp, as
none of the surface will have been scraped off.


                    Fried Tomatoes. Time—15 minutes.

1 lb. tomatoes, 2 oz. butter.

Cut the tomatoes in halves. Heat the butter in the frying-pan, and fry

                          BREAD AND BISCUITS.


          African Shoots or Shrewsbury Biscuits. Time—½ hour.

¼ lb. butter, ¼ lb. castor sugar, ½ lb. flour, 1 egg, a few drops
flavouring (essence of lemon, vanilla, &c.).

Beat the butter and sugar to a cream, add to them the flavouring and the
egg, well beaten, mix all well together, then stir the flour in
smoothly. Pass the paste through a biscuit-forcer on to a greased tin,
or turn it on to a floured board, roll it out as thin as possible, and
cut it into rounds with a cutter or tumbler. Place the biscuits on a
greased tin, and bake 20 minutes.


                          Bola. Time—2½ hours.

_Crust_: 1 lb. dough, ½ lb. butter, 1 oz. brown sugar. _Inside_: 4 oz.
ground almonds, ½ oz. ground cinnamon, ½ lb. brown sugar, ½ lb. candied
peel, 1 egg.

Shred the peel, and mix in the sugar, spice, almonds, and egg. Rub the
butter well into the dough, sweeten it, roll it out thin, cut off a
strip, and line the inside of a greased tin with it. Spread the inside
mixture smoothly over the remainder of the dough with a knife, roll up
like a roly-poly pudding; cut it into four pieces, and fill the tin,
placing the cut ends upwards. Bake about ¼ hour in a hot oven, then 1¼
hour in a cooler part of the oven. When nearly baked, make holes, and
pour in clarified sugar.


                          Bread. Time—4 hours.

3½ lbs. flour, 1 oz. yeast, 1 teaspoonful salt, 1 teaspoonful castor
sugar, 1½ pint tepid water.

Put the yeast and sugar into a basin, and cream them together with a
wooden spoon till liquid, then add the tepid water. Pass the flour
through a sieve, put it in a large basin, make a well in the centre,
pour in the yeast and water, work in a little flour from the sides,
cover with paper, and set it in a warm place (on the fender) to rise 20
minutes. Then work in the remainder of the flour with the hand, till the
dough is smooth, and set to rise 2 hours. Then turn on to a floured
board, and knead for a ¼ hour. Divide the dough into two pieces. For tin
loaves, flour the tins, put in the dough, prick the top, and set to rise
once more ¼ hour. For cottage loaves, cut each piece again into two, one
piece twice as large as the other, form into balls with the hand, put
the small one on the top of the large one, and make a hole in the top
with the finger. Bake in the hottest part of the oven ¼ hour, then
remove to a cooler part for 1½ hour. If the loaf sound hollow when
tapped, it is done.


                  Unfermented Bread. Time—20 minutes.

ingredients from the second basin with 2 eggs. Thoroughly mix and beat
them for about 5 minutes. Set this sponge to rise again for about 1½
hour. Then shape the mixture into buns and bake on a greased tin for ½
hour. When cooked and while still hot, brush them over with a little
milk and sugar to glaze them.


                       Butter Cakes. Time—½ hour.

3 minutes over the fire. Serve with sugar or salt.

_A cup of cornflour_ can be made in the same way.


                     Barley Water. Time—20 minutes.

2 dessertspoonfuls prepared barley, 1 pint milk or water.

Put the barley into a basin and mix to a smooth paste with a little cold
milk or water, then add to it gradually the boiling milk or water,
stirring carefully with a wooden spoon all the time. Boil 10 minutes,
stir continually and avoid lumps. Sweeten, and if made with water serve
with lemon-juice.


            Raw Beef Tea (for typhoid fever). Time—1¾ hour.

Scrape a small piece of very lean gravy beef, put it in a tumbler, add a
pinch of salt, and just cover with cold water. Let it stand 1½ hour,

permitted by the doctor.


                  Beef Tea (strongest). Time—2 hours.

1 pint of water to 1 lb. gravy beef.

Cut the beef into pieces about half an inch square, removing all fat and
skin, and soak for 1 hour in the water. Then add 1 teaspoonful of salt,
and place in a covered jar, which must stand in a saucepan of boiling
water for 1 hour. Keep the saucepan well filled, and the water boiling,
but be careful not to let it enter the jar. Strain and serve.


                     Whole Beef Tea. Time—2½ hours.

½ lb. gravy beef to 1 pint water.

Cut the beef into pieces ½ inch square, removing all the skin and fat,
and let the beef soak in ½ pint cold water. When the juices have been
extracted (the pieces should soak all night) take out the beef and place
it in a jar with the remainder of the cold water. Let this simmer 2
hours, then add the liquor to the cold raw juice, take out the pieces of
meat, pound them, return them to the liquor, and heat all together.
Flavour with green celery stalk, or a little Worcester sauce.


                           Calf’s Foot Jelly.

loaf sugar, 3 whites and shells of eggs, spice.

Cut the foot into 3 pieces, put them in a saucepan and add the cold
water, simmer gently 8 hours then strain into a basin. When the jelly is
cold, carefully skim off the fat, dip a clean cloth into boiling water,
and wipe any remaining fat off the surface with the cloth. Melt the
jelly in a saucepan, then add the sugar, lemon-juice, and rind, whites
of eggs well beaten, the shells and spice. Whisk over the fire till the
jelly boils, then simmer, with the lid off 20 minutes. Fix a cloth,
thoroughly rinsed in boiling water, on to a chair (as for clearing soup,
see page 2), strain the jelly through it, and cover with a blanket while
it is running through. Pour into a mould, which has been rinsed in cold
water.


                    To Boil a Chicken. Time—2 hours.

slices of tongue, smoked beef, or worsht.


                             Chicken Broth.

Cut up an old fowl, cover with water, and stew it with 2 onions till it
goes to pieces. Season with pepper and salt, skim well, strain, and
serve very hot with sippets of toast.

Chickens’ necks stewed in the same way make very good broth.


                    To Roast a Chicken. Time—1 hour.

1 fowl (smoked beef fat). _Stuffing_: 1 tablespoonful chopped suet, 1
tablespoonful bread-crumbs, ½ tablespoonful chopped parsley, ½
tablespoonful chopped herbs, grated nutmeg, pepper and salt to taste,
grated lemon-rind, 1 egg.

Dry the fowl well; prepare the stuffing as below, put it in at the
breast, and sew or skewer it up. (If liked, lard the fowl with the
smoked beef fat.) Rub with a little pepper and salt, dredge lightly with
flour, and leave a little while. Then put a piece of greased paper over
the breast, and put down to roast. Remove the paper ¼ hour before the
fowl is done.

_For the stuffing_: Chop the suet and parsley fine, add to them the
bread-crumbs, herbs, pepper, and salt, nutmeg, lemon-rind, and lastly
the egg, well beaten. Mix all well together.


                Cornflour Blanc-mange. Time—20 minutes.

2 tablespoonfuls cornflour, 1 pint milk, 1 tablespoonful loaf sugar,
stick cinnamon.

Put the sugar, cinnamon, and nearly all the milk, in a saucepan to boil.
Meanwhile mix the cornflour in a basin to a smooth paste, with the
remainder of the milk. When the milk boils, add to it the cornflour,
return all to the saucepan, and boil quickly 3 minutes, stirring all the
time. Dip a mould in cold water, pour in the cornflour after the
cinnamon has been taken out. When cold turn out, and serve with jam.


                          Gruel. Time—¾ hour.

2 dessertspoonfuls oatmeal (fine or Scotch), 2 tablespoonfuls milk, ½
saltspoonful salt, 3 gills boiling water.

Mix the oatmeal and salt to a smooth paste with the milk. When the water
boils add it gradually, stirring all the time. Let it stand ½ minute,
then pour it into the saucepan, letting the grits remain in the basin.
Stir the gruel till it boils, then simmer 10 minutes more if fine, ½
hour more if Scotch oatmeal. Sweeten to taste.


                    Lait de Poule. Time—10 minutes.

1 gill boiling water, ¾ wineglassful sherry, 1 egg, (nutmeg if liked),
sugar.

Beat up the egg, pour the nearly boiling water over it, add the sherry
and nutmeg, and sweeten. This drink is very good for a cold, when no
milk is handy.


                               Lemonade.

2 lemons, 1 quart water; loaf sugar to taste.

Shave off the yellow rind of the lemon, place the sugar in a jug, put
the rind in a strainer, and pour 1 pint of boiling water over it on to
the sugar. Squeeze the lemons through a strainer, add to them 1 pint of
cold water, then mix all together.


                             Mutton Broth.

This broth is made just like that on page 5, but no rice or barley
should be thrown in. The broth should be strained through a sieve, and
served with sippets of toast. Special care should be taken to have it
entirely free from fat.


                              Toast Water.

Toast a _crust_ of bread carefully all over, but do not burn it black.
Fill a jug with boiling water, _then_ put in the toast. A bright liquid
the colour of sherry will be the result.

                               APPENDIX.


                     FORMATION OF COOKERY CLASSES.

In these few pages it is our object to give, as clearly and concisely as
possible, directions for the formation and conduct of the Jewish Cookery
Classes which are now increasing among us. Several years’ experience at
the Bayswater Jewish Schools and at the Portuguese Jews’ Schools has
enabled us to ascertain accurately the cost of starting and maintaining
such a class, and we have endeavoured to give a clear statement of the
necessary expenditure, together with a list of the requisite utensils.

“In schools in which the Inspector reports that special and appropriate
provision is made for the practical teaching of cookery, a grant of four
shillings is made on account of any girl (over twelve years of age
before the conclusion of the course) who has attended not less than
forty hours during the school year at the cookery class, and is
presented for examination in the elementary subjects in any
Standard.”[2]—(New Code of Regulations, 1882.)

A class-room can easily be adapted as the kitchen by the introduction of
a good-sized cupboard and a simple open range. A kitchen table should be
procured with screw legs, so that it can conveniently be taken to
pieces, and removed after the lesson.

Two or three demonstration lessons, at which a large number of girls may
attend, given at the commencement of the course, will enable the girls
to set about the practice lessons with some degree of facility. No
demonstration should last longer than an hour and a half, so that the
teacher may secure the entire attention of the pupils. These lessons
will afford an opportunity for dwelling on the value of foods, both from
an economical and medical point of view.

The practice lessons should last two hours, so that there may be plenty
of time for the pupils to thoroughly cleanse and put away every article
used, scrub the floor and table and tidy the hearth. In these two hours
the luncheon hour might easily be included.

The number of girls at a practice lesson should never exceed twelve, and
they should work two together at one board. They should be shown how to
weigh carefully each ingredient, and should themselves regulate, by a
clock, the cooking of their own dishes. Perfect order must be
maintained, and it is very necessary that neatness should be insisted on
throughout every stage, and that special attention should be paid to
personal cleanliness. The girls should be made to read through the
recipe to be prepared, and to collect all the ingredients required
before they actually commence to cook.

It is desirable that the various processes should be carried on with the
simplest means, so that every girl may be fairly expected to find in her
own home all such utensils as are employed during the lesson. It is,
therefore, better to avoid the expense of a mincing-machine,
knife-machine, and other labour-saving appliances.

Footnote 2:

  In order that the school may gain this grant, the teacher must have
  passed the requisite examination of the National Training School for
  Cookery.

                  HINTS ON CLEANING KITCHEN UTENSILS.

_Saucepans_ should always be filled immediately after use, with hot
water and soda. When they have stood some time, they must be scoured
well, inside and out, with silver sand, well rinsed in hot water, and
thoroughly dried in front of the fire. The lids must be wiped, and hung
up separately.

_Frying-pans_ should never be washed, but should be wiped thoroughly
clean with soft paper immediately after use.

_Tin vessels_ must be thoroughly washed in hot water, dried, lightly
covered with whiting, and then rubbed bright with wash-leather.

_Kitchen tables_ must be washed over with a wet cloth, sprinkled with
silver sand, and thoroughly scrubbed, the way of the grain, with hot
water and soda. All the sand must then be carefully wiped off with a
damp cloth. Should the table be very greasy, damp fuller’s earth must be
used instead of sand.

_Pastry boards and wooden utensils_ must be washed over with a wet
cloth, sprinkled with crushed soda and boiling water, then scrubbed
well, the way of the grain, and dried with a cloth.

_Knives_ must be placed in a jug, and covered with hot water as far as
the haft, then wiped quite dry, cleaned with bath brick on a wooden
board placed in a slanting position. When quite bright, the dust must be
wiped off with a dry cloth.

The prongs of _forks_ must be cleaned with a piece of rag dipped in bath
brick.

_Plates and dishes_ must be washed in hot water and soda, then rinsed in
cold water, and left in the plate-rack to dry.
