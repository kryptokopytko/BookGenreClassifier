BREAD,

MUFFINS, ROLLS, WAFFLES, FRITTERS, ETC.


WARNING

The making of bread is, to a large degree, a chemical operation, and
should be carried on with as much accuracy as a chemist would use in
his laboratory. The flour should be weighed or measured. The other
ingredients should also be weighed or measured accurately.

Temperature is a particularly important factor in making good bread.
=Do not let sponge or dough get chilled.=

When potatoes are used, be sure that they are sound, white and mealy,
and in the fall, when the new crop is on the market, be careful that
the potatoes are fully ripe. More failures in bread making are due to
the use of potatoes which are thought to be ripe, but which are not
fully matured, than any other one thing.

In making cake, a difference may be noted if the eggs are large or
small, if small use either more eggs or more water or milk.


RECIPE FOR BREAD

(University of Nevada Method)

Warm Gold Medal Flour in oven.

  2 cups milk, scalded,
  2 cups potato water,
  2 medium potatoes, mashed very fine,
  1 cake Fleishmann’s compressed yeast in ½ cup luke warm water,
  1 teaspoonful salt,
  1 tablespoonful sugar,
  1 teaspoonful lard.

Add Gold Medal flour until mixture has appearance of cake batter; beat
with wooden spoon until very light. Let stand.

Add Gold Medal flour and knead until smooth, brush butter over top of
dough, cover and let raise to twice original size.

Mould into loaves and let raise twenty minutes.

Put in very hot oven for ten minutes, then bake in slow oven forty-five
minutes.


WHITE BREAD

Quick Method

  1 quart Gold Medal Flour sifted,
  1 cup or ½ pint milk or water,
  1 cake compressed yeast,
  ½ teaspoonful salt,
  2 teaspoonfuls sugar,
  1 tablespoonful melted butter.

Dissolve yeast by breaking into a cup and adding 1 teaspoon sugar, mix
and let it stand 3 minutes. Sift flour in a bowl, make well in center,
and add water, salt, sugar, butter and yeast, mix and knead well, put
in a warm place to raise 1½ hours, or until light. Turn out on molding
board, knead lightly, shape into loaves, put in well buttered pans, let
raise ¾ hour. Bake 45 minutes.


BREAD

Cook 2 medium sized potatoes in 1 quart water. Use the water. Must be
1 quart to scald 1 teacup Gold Medal flour. Mash potatoes and add to
the flour, using more flour if necessary. Soak 1 cake of yeast in a
cup of warm water. When this is cold, stir into the mixture already
prepared. Let it stand over night, stirring occasionally. Set in a warm
place. Next morning add 1 heaping teaspoonful of lard, 2 of sugar and 1
teaspoonful of salt. If necessary ½ teaspoonful of soda. Stir in flour
until proper consistency; knead hard. Put to rise and knead lightly the
second time; put in pans to rise again. Bake in a moderate oven. This
also makes nice light rolls.

  ½ cup sugar,
  1 compressed yeast cake.

Scald the milk and add the water. When luke warm add salt, sugar, yeast
cake (dissolved in 2 tablespoons water) and sufficient Gold Medal
Whole Wheat flour to make a batter that will drop from the spoon. Beat
continuously for 5 minutes. Cover and let stand in a warm place for 3
hours; then add sufficient Whole Wheat flour to make a dough. Knead at

  2 cups potato water,
  1 yeast cake,
  1 quart Gold Medal Flour,
  1 tablespoonful salt,
  1 small cup molasses or sugar,
  1 tablespoonful melted lard.

Dissolve yeast cake in lukewarm water. Mix all ingredients into as
stiff a dough as can be stirred with a spoon, adding lukewarm water to
make it the proper consistency. Let it stand over night. In the morning
stir it down with a spoon thoroughly. Have bread tins greased. Fill
each one about ½ full and let rise to the top of the pans. Bake in
moderate oven 1 hour for good-sized loaves.

  ½ teaspoonful salt,

luke-warm add the yeast, moistened in two tablespoons warm water. Add
sufficient Rye Flour to make a batter, and beat thoroughly for ten
minutes. Cover and stand in a warm place for 2½ hours. Knead this dough
quickly until it loses its stickiness. Divide it into three or four
loaves, put each loaf in a square pan; cover and stand for an hour in
the same warm place, about 75 Fahr., until it has doubled in bulk,
brush the top quickly with warm water and put it in a hot oven. When
brown, reduce the heat and bake ¾ of an hour. Turn each loaf from the
pan; stand on a board covered with a cloth but do not cover the loaves.
It is better to tip the board so that the air may circulate around the
entire loaf. This makes a nice crisp crust.

SOUR MILK DOUGHNUTS

  2 eggs, beaten light,
  3 even tablespoonfuls melted butter,
  4 cups Gold Medal Flour,
  1 cup sugar,
  1 cup sour milk,
  ½ teaspoonful soda,
  1 saltspoonful each of cinnamon and salt.

Enough more Gold Medal Flour to make just soft enough to roll out.
Mix the dough rather soft at first. Have the board well floured, and
the fat heating. Roll only a large spoonful at first. Cut into rings
with an open cutter. Mix the trimmings with another spoonful. Work it
lightly till well floured and roll again. Roll and cut all out before
frying. The fat should be hot enough for the dough to rise to the top
instantly.


DOUGHNUTS AND CRULLERS

The fat should be in a deep pot (to obviate any danger of boiling
over), and should be of sufficient depth to cover the dough, when
first dropped in. It should be smoking hot, or the dough will absorb
grease and be soggy. Not more than half a dozen should be dropped in at
any one time, or the fat will be unduly cooled and some of the cakes
submerged during the entire cooking; in which case the cakes when
cooked will be greasy and not light. One or two pieces of dough should
be cooked first as testers. When done the cakes should be drained on
unglazed paper, then rolled in powdered sugar.


ALMOND COOKIES

  ⅓ cup almonds blanched and finely chopped,
  ¼ teaspoonful cloves,
  ⅛ teaspoonful salt,

  1 egg beaten lightly,
  ½ teaspoonful cinnamon,
  ½ teaspoonful nutmeg,

  1 cup Gold Medal Flour,
  2 teaspoonfuls baking powder.

Cream the butter; add the sugar gradually; add egg well beaten without
separating; almonds, Gold Medal Flour, oats, spices, baking powder,
thoroughly mixed; add lemon rind and sherry. Drop in piles about the
size of an English walnut—1½ inches apart on a buttered sheet. Spread
with a spatula and press the half of an almond meat on top of each.
Bake in a moderate oven 12 to 15 minutes.

if needed. Mold with the hands in round buns. Place 1 inch apart on
greased pans. Brush with milk, sprinkle with chopped citron, and bake
in quick oven.


ROLLED OATS CRISPS

  2 eggs,
  2½ cups Gold Medal Rolled Oats,

the rolled oats and then mix all together. Drop in small pieces on
greased baking pan, leaving a good space between. Bake in a hot quick
oven until crisp and brown. Take off with a knife.


HUCKLEBERRY SHORT CAKE

Two cups sugar, ½ cup butter, 1 teaspoonful salt, 1 pint milk, 2
heaping teaspoonfuls baking powder sifted into 3 cups Gold Medal Flour,

very thick batter. Bake in greased dripping-pan, break in squares,
serve hot with butter.

MOLASSES COOKIES

Put the molasses, water, soda and lard in a bowl, mix them together;
then add flour enough to make a nice dough, suitable to roll out and
cut; wash with milk or water on top.

Molasses cookies are very common cakes, but they are not easy to
make, for the reason that there is no rule you can work by that will
answer in all cases. All molasses does not work alike; some kinds will
bear more water than others, and the weather has to be taken into
consideration. In cold weather you can use more water than in warm
weather. Sometimes you can use the same quantity of water as molasses.
Be very careful and not get the dough too stiff, and do not work any
more than is necessary to mix.

PEACH COBBLER, SOUTHERN STYLE

A large pie baked in shallow baking tins from one to one and a half
inches in depth with bottom and top crust, glazed and sugared on top,
and cut out in squares or triangular pieces.

Fine puff paste is too rich for this purpose; ordinary flaky pie crust
made with ten or twelve ounces of butter, to a pound of Gold Medal
Flour, is best; cover the bottom of the pan with a sheet of paste
rolled quite thin, fill with ripe peeled peaches, strew over them half
their weight of sugar, and a little nutmeg; cover with another thin
sheet of paste, and bake about three-quarters of an hour; when half
done brush over the top with egg and water and strew granulated sugar
over; put back and bake to a rich color; when the fruit is too dry to
make its own syrup, make a sauce to go with the cobbler; all sorts of
fruit or rhubarb can be used this way; canned fruit should be stewed
down till the juice becomes thick before being put in the paste lined
tins.


BAKED CUSTARD

  3 yolks,
  1 egg,
  1 pint milk,
  1⅓ cups sugar,

melt the sugar until it turns a light brown then add it to the boiling
milk.

BLANC MANGE

Parboil eighteen ounces of Jordan, and three ounces of bitter almonds,
in a quart and a pint of water, for about three minutes; drain them on
a sieve, and remove the skins, and wash them in cold water; after they
have been soaked in cold water for half an hour, pound them in a mortar
with six ounces of sugar, until the whole presents an appearance of a
soft paste. This must then be placed in a basin with eighteen ounces
of loaf sugar, and mixed with a pint and a half of water; cover the
basin with a sheet of paper twisted around the edges, and allow the
preparation to stand in a cool place for about an hour in order to
extract the flavor of the almonds more effectually. The milk should
then be strained off from the almonds through a napkin, with pressure
by wringing at both ends. Add three ounces of clarified gelatine to the
milk of almonds. Pour the blanc mange into a mould embedded in rough
ice, and when set firm turn it out on its dish with caution, having
first dipped the mould in warm water.

butter mould or the bottom of a figured glass. Keep it on ice till very
hard; or pile it lightly on a small fancy dish and you may call it

PIES


BANANA RAISIN PIE

Cook ½ cup chopped seeded raisins in 1 cup water until plump. Take
from fire, add 2 tablespoonfuls sifted cracker crumbs mixed with 1
tablespoonful flour and 1 teaspoonful butter. Let stand covered until
cold. Cut 1 large banana in thin slices, add ¼ teaspoonful cinnamon, 2
tablespoonfuls lemon juice, 3 tablespoonfuls sugar, ¾ teaspoonful lemon
extract and grated rind ½ lemon. Combine mixture, add 1 well-beaten egg
and 2 tablespoonfuls seeded raisins cut in pieces. Bake between two
crusts.


LEMON PIE

One small teacup of boiling water, put in juice and rind of one lemon,
one teaspoonful of corn starch to thicken; then add four egg yolks, one
cup of sugar, mixed together; beat the whites of two eggs stiff and
put in with egg yolks and sugar. After custard is done put on top the
whites of the other two eggs, put in oven and brown. Bake pie crust
first.


APPLE PIE

Stew green or ripe apples, when you have pared and cored them. Mash to
a smooth compote, sweeten to taste, and while hot, stir in a teaspoon
butter for each pie. Season with nutmeg. When cool, fill your crust,
and either cross-bar the top with strips of paste, or make without
cover. Eat cold, with powdered sugar strewed over it.


PUMPKIN PIE

The following measure will make three good sized pies: Put into your
mixing dish one quart and a pint of stewed and strained pumpkin, about
one-quarter pound sugar, half cup molasses, half a tablespoonful
each ginger, nutmeg, a scant teaspoonful each of cinnamon and salt,
one-quarter cup melted butter and one quart of milk. Beat six eggs and
add to the mixture, and stir until the ingredients are well blended.
Bake in a good, deep crust.


RHUBARB PIE

Select the red stalks, cut off where the leaves commence, strip off the
outside skin, then cut in pieces one-half inch long; line a pie dish
with paste, put a layer of the rhubarb nearly an inch deep, a large
teacup of sugar, sprinkle with salt, shake over a little Gold Medal
Flour, cover with a crust, slit in the center, trim off the edge and
bake in a quick oven until done. Rhubarb pies made in this way are
superior to those made of the fruit stewed.


LEMON CUSTARD PIE

Make a good pie crust and prick bottom. Put one cup sugar and one cup
water in a saucepan and let come to a boil. Mix one tablespoonful
cornstarch in a little water and add to water and sugar on stove. When
thick take off stove and add a small chunk of butter; stir it up. Stir

whites of two eggs until thick and spread over pie when cooked; then
put in oven to brown.

strained. Line pie plate with paste; put in cranberry jam; wash the
edges, lay three narrow bars across; fasten at edge, then three more
across, forming diamond-shaped spaces. Lay rim of paste; wash with egg
wash; bake in quick oven until paste is cooked.

Stew, stone and mash enough prunes to make a cupful of pulp. Add a cup
cream, yolks of three eggs, beaten, flavor with vanilla, add pinch
of salt; bake in a rich under-crust as quickly as possible; beat the
whites of the eggs with two tablespoonfuls of sugar, spread over top,
return to oven and brown very highly.


MINCE MEAT

The following is an excellent recipe for mince meat and it will fill
twelve to fourteen quart jars. Chop fine six pounds of cooked beef
and mix with two pounds of chopped suet; add twelve pounds of chopped
apples, five pounds of raisins, three and a half pounds currants, one
pound of citron and two pounds of brown sugar; mix thoroughly and then
add seven cups of molasses, two tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, three of
nutmeg, two quarts of sweet cider, one quart of boiled cider, three
cups of sherry wine and one pint of brandy. Cook twenty minutes,
stirring frequently.


MOLASSES PIE

Four eggs, one cup sugar, two cups molasses. Boil sugar and molasses
two minutes, then pour off into another cup sugar. Flavor with spice,
cloves, cinnamon and butter. Bake thin crust.


RASPBERRY PIE

Take two boxes of red raspberries, mash and add about 1 cupful of
powdered sugar. Let stand at least 2 hours in ice box, then put through
cheese cloth, add about ½ cup powdered sugar, 1 cup water, juice of ½
lemon and small bottle of cream. Freeze. This mixture makes about a
good quart.

Grate the rind of the lemons into a bowl, and squeeze in the juice.
Make a boiling syrup of the sugar and half the water and pour it hot
on the lemon zest, and juice, and let it remain until cold; then add
the rest of the water. Strain the lemonade into a freezer and freeze
as usual and at last add the whites whipped to a firm froth, beat, and
freeze again. The scalding draws the flavor from the lemons. It should
never be boiled and fewer lemons used when they are very large. This
ice is perfectly white.


APPLE MERINGUE PIE

Pare, slice, stew and sweeten ripe, tart and juicy apples, mash and
season with nutmeg (or lemon peel), fill crust and bake till done;
spread over the apple a thick meringue made by whipping to froth whites
of three eggs for each pie, sweetening with three tablespoonfuls
powdered sugar; flavor with vanilla, beat well, and cover pie
three-quarters of an inch thick. Set back in a quick oven till well
“set,” and eat cold. In their season substitute peaches for apples.


CUSTARD PIE

Six eggs, one and one-half cupfuls of sugar, one cupful of butter, six
tablespoonfuls of corn starch or Gold Medal Flour and three cups of
milk; flavor to taste. This is sufficient for three pies; bake with one
crust only.


PINEAPPLE PIE

Slice of butter and a cup of sugar beat to a cream; add yolks of four
eggs well beaten; then add a small can of grated pineapple. Last of all
add the whites of two eggs well beaten and enough milk to suit taste.
Line a deep pie plate with a rich crust. Put in custard and bake. When
done beat the whites of two eggs, spread over top and brown.

light brown. Put the filling in, the meringue on top and brown in oven.

SOUPS


CONSOMME OR PLAIN MEAT STOCK FOR SOUP

Consomme or stock forms the basis of all meat soups, gravies and
purees. The simpler it is made, the longer it keeps. It is best made
of fresh uncooked beef and some broken bones, to which may be added
the remnants of broken meats. In a home where meat forms part of the
every-day diet, a good cook will seldom be without a stock-pot.

Four pounds of beef and broken bones, one gallon of cold water and two
teaspoonfuls of salt. Put the meat and water on the back of the stove
and let it slowly come to a boil, then simmer three or four hours,
until the water is boiled away one-half; add the salt, strain and set
to cool, in an earthenware dish well covered. When cold, take off the
fat from the top and it is ready for use. To make soup for a family of
six, take one-quarter of the stock, to which add one-quarter of boiling
water, and any vegetables desired—boil three hours. Season with salt
and pepper.


BARLEY BROTH

Put two pounds of shin beef in one gallon of water. Add a teacup of
pearl barley, 3 large onions and a small bunch of parsley minced, 3
potatoes sliced, a little thyme and pepper, salt to taste. Simmer
steadily three hours, and stir often, so that the meat will not burn.
Do not let it boil. Always stir soup or broth with a wooden spoon.


TURKEY SOUP

Place the remains of a cold turkey and what is left of the dressing and
gravy in a pot, and cover it with cold water. Simmer slowly four hours,
and let stand until the next day. Take off what fat may have arisen,
and take out with a skimmer all the bits of bones. Put the soup on to
heat until at boiling point, then thicken slightly with flour stirred
into a cup of cream, and season to taste. Pick off all the meat from
bones, put it back in the soup, boil up and serve.


MOCK TURTLE SOUP

Take a calf’s head, a knuckle of veal, a hock of ham, six potatoes
sliced thin, three turnips, parsley and sweet marjoram chopped fine,
and pepper. Forced meat balls of veal and beef, half a pint of wine,
one dozen egg balls, juice of a lemon. The calf’s head must have had
the brains removed, and must have been boiled previously till the meat
slips off the bone. The broth must be saved, so as to use in the soup.
Cut the head in small pieces after boiling. The veal and ham also must
have been boiled and cut up, and all simmered for a couple of hours in
the broth made by the calf’s head. Now put all together. The forced
meat balls and egg balls should be added, and all boiled about ten
minutes.


VEGETABLE SOUP WITH STOCK

Cut three onions, three turnips, one carrot and four potatoes. Put them
into a stew-pan with two tablespoonfuls of butter and a teaspoonful
of powdered sugar. After it has cooked ten minutes, add two quarts
of stock, and when it comes to a boil put aside to simmer until the
vegetables are tender—about one-half hour.

stand over night. Skim off the fat in the morning and pour the broth
into a bowl. Into the dish in which the broth was made put one-third
of a teacupful rice in a teacupful of cold water, and steam as before
until the rice is soft; then pour in the broth and steam an hour or two
longer.

SALADS


IDEAS IN SALADS

Prepare celery stalks very carefully by removing the stringy fiber
until entirely free from shreds. Chop quite fine, and to two cupfuls
of celery add two cupfuls of chopped lettuce, the latter crisp and
fresh as possible. Season with salt, pepper and thyme, vinegar, olive
oil, bay leaf. If possible, add half a teaspoonful shoyu, or Japanese
sauce, which greatly improves the flavor. Mix all thoroughly and then
add crab, shrimp, sardine, spiced mackerel or halibut filling. Boiled
halibut, chilled in salt water, makes a good combination with crab, and
when broken into small portions and allowed to stand for an hour or so,
in the same salt water with crab, can with difficulty be distinguished
from the crab itself. For sardine, potato, and meat salads, a
tablespoonful of onion juice is desirable.

Make mayonnaise dressing by using the yolks of three or four eggs,
according to the quantity desired, and after beating add, drop by
drop, pure olive oil, stirring constantly until the mixture begins to
thicken. Then a larger quantity of oil may be stirred in until the
mixture becomes of proper consistency, about like heavy cream; do not
season until thickened for fear of curdling. Salt very sparingly, and
if desired sift in a little cayenne pepper, a few drops of lemon, two
teaspoonfuls of spiced mustard vinegar from mustard pickles.


CHICKEN SALAD

Cut cold roast or boiled chicken in small dice, add celery cut fine,
season with salt and pepper. Mix with French dressing and put aside for
an hour or more. Just before serving stir in some mayonnaise slightly
thinned with lemon juice or French dressing, arrange on lettuce leaves
and cover with thick mayonnaise.


CRAB SALAD

One pint of crab meat, two stalks of celery, cut fine; one hard-boiled
egg, chopped fine, and one tomato cut into small pieces; season with
salt, pepper and vinegar, mix in salad bowl, garnishing it with crisp
leaves of lettuce; dress with mayonnaise dressing.


LOBSTER SALAD

Cut the lobster into small squares and season with two tablespoonfuls
of vinegar, two of oil, one teaspoonful of salt and pepper and let it
stand in a cool place for an hour. When ready to serve line the salad
bowl with crisp lettuce leaves, and after mixing the lobster thoroughly
with mayonnaise place it on the lettuce. Serve with toasted crackers
and cheese.


SALMON SALAD

Remove bones and skin from salmon. Drain off liquid. Mix with French
dressing or thin mayonnaise; set away for awhile. Finish same as
lobster salad. Other fish salads may be prepared in same manner.


TOMATO SALAD

Pare with sharp knife. Slice and lay in salad bowl. Make dressing in
the following manner: Work up saltspoon of each of salt, pepper and
mustard, two tablespoonfuls of salad oil, adding a few drops at a
time, and, when thoroughly mixed, whip in with an egg, beaten, four
tablespoonfuls vinegar; toss up with fork.

EGG SALAD

Boil six eggs until the yolks are very mealy. Boil also one dozen
medium-sized potatoes, with jackets on. Peel eggs and potatoes and cut
in dice. Add two slices onions. Put first a layer of one, then of the
other, until all is used. Pour over it some cream salad dressing.


A DELICIOUS SALAD FOR STUFFED PEPPERS

One can of sardines picked into fine pieces with a fork, two
tablespoonfuls of chopped olives, two tablespoonfuls of chopped
pickles, mayonnaise dressing and salt and pepper to taste. Remove
the seeds, membrane and stem end from the peppers and soak in salt
water. Mix the olives, pickles, etc., with the sardines and add enough
mayonnaise dressing to hold it together. Then drain the peppers dry and
fill with the salad. Garnish the plate with lettuce leaves and olives.


SARDINE SANDWICH

Take one can of sardines, remove the back-bone from the fish, add juice
of one lemon, one tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce. Mix the above
thoroughly and spread on buttered bread. Before placing layers of bread
together, add a few slices of pickled onions.


SARDINE PASTE

Work required amount of sardines into a paste with a broad knife or
spatula. Add to this very tiny pickled onions, the quantity depending
upon the taste, about one-quarter as much onion as paste, is good.
Season with Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, paprika, celery salt
and a liberal amount of lemon juice.

This is delicious for sandwiches, to serve on small pieces of toast
with cocktails, or on crackers with salad.


SANDWICHES

Take each fish, lightly scrape off skin and remove the tail, and pick
the meat into convenient sized pieces with a fork. Put the pieces into
a bowl of lemon juice and let stand a few minutes. Then drain and
spread on thin slices of bread between fresh lettuce leaves. If the
“Soused” Sardines are used, substitute mayonnaise dressing for the
lemon juice.


SARDINE SANDWICHES

Very tasty sandwiches can be prepared by mincing fish with half the
quantity of hard-boiled eggs and moistening with mayonnaise dressing.
Place this mixture between thin slices of bread and cut into small
squares with a sharp knife.


CHICKEN AND LOBSTER SALAD

  ½ chicken,
  ½ pound tinned peas,
  1 tablespoonful chopped parsley and olives,
  1 pound tinned lobster,
  Mayonnaise dressing,
  ¼ pint oil.

Remove the meat from bones and cut up into small pieces. Sprinkle over
with lemon juice and stand on one side for thirty minutes. Then mix
with peas, stir the chopped parsley and olives into a mayonnaise and
mix all well together. Garnish with gherkins and tiny onions. Asparagus
may be substituted for peas.

CABBAGE SALAD a la CALAIS

First make a dressing in the following manner: Take two raw eggs, two
level teaspoonfuls of salt and two level teaspoonfuls of dry mustard
and a quarter teaspoonful of cayenne pepper or paprika and about five
teaspoonfuls of sugar and one tablespoonful of butter and add two
tablespoonfuls of milk, mix well and beat with a fork. Then take one
cup of vinegar and boil separately, pour slowly over the other mixture
and when this is done boil slowly until thick. Grind up a fair-sized
head of cabbage, one medium sized onion and two green peppers from
which the seeds and fibre have been removed. Then mix with the dressing
and serve.


HOT SLAW

Pick off the bad leaves from head of small cabbage, slice or cut the
cabbage very thin, scald it 5 minutes in 2 quarts of boiling water and
drain through a colander. Mix it well with a sauce made of ¼ cup of hot
vinegar, 1 cup of sour cream, yolks of 2 eggs, 3 tablespoonfuls of oil,
salt and pepper to taste.


JELLIED CHICKEN AND CELERY SALAD

Make the chicken jelly and set it in a border mould. Chop three bunches
of celery, and mix with one can of asparagus tips. When the jelly is
cold set on a platter, and heap the celery and asparagus in the center.
Slice four hard-boiled eggs and lay around the jelly in little piles,
alternating with mayonnaise dressing.

This is also nice made with fruit jelly with fruit in center, omitting
the egg and using French dressing made with lemon instead of the
mayonnaise.


ROMAINE SALAD

Take the heart of a Romaine, don’t wash, but wipe with a clean towel,
one-half pint of cream, mix in pepper and salt to taste. This is the
proper way to eat Romaine, and the only way it is served in Paris,
especially in private families. No dressing.


MAYONNAISE DRESSING

Put the yolk of an egg into a cup with salt-spoonful of salt, and beat
until light, one-half teaspoonful of mustard and beat again. Then add
olive oil, drop by drop, then a few drops of vinegar and the same of
lemon juice. Continue this process until the egg has absorbed a little
more than a half a teacup of oil; finish by adding a very little
cayenne pepper and sugar.


FRENCH DRESSING

Mix one-fourth of a teaspoonful of salt, dash of white pepper, 3
tablespoonfuls olive oil. Stir for few minutes, then gradually add
1 tablespoonful vinegar, stirring rapidly until mixture is slightly
thickened and vinegar cannot be noticed. Mixture will separate in about
twenty minutes.

FISH


TO FRY FISH

After the fish is well cleansed, lay it on a folded towel and dry
out all the water; when well wiped and dry, roll it in wheat flour,
rolled crackers, grated stale bread or Indian meal, whichever
may be preferred; Gold Medal Flour will generally be liked. Have
a thick-bottomed frying-pan with plenty of sweet lard salted (a
tablespoonful of salt to each pound of lard) for fresh fish which have
not been previously salted; let it become boiling hot, then lay the
fish in and let it fry gently until one side is a fine, delicate brown,
then turn the other; when both are done take it up carefully and serve
quickly, or keep it covered with a tin cover, and set the dish where it
will keep hot.


TO BROIL FISH

Rub the bars of your gridiron with dripping or a piece of beef suet, to
prevent the fish from sticking. Put a good piece of butter into a dish,
enough salt and pepper to season the fish. Lay the fish on it when it
is broiled, and with a knife put the butter over every part. Serve very
hot.


TO BAKE FISH WHOLE

Cut off the head and split the fish down nearly to the tail; prepare
a dressing of bread, butter, pepper and salt, moisten with a little
water. Fill the dish with this dressing, and bind it together with a
piece of string; lay the fish on a bake-pan and pour round it a little
water and melted butter. Baste frequently. A good-sized fish will bake
in an hour. Serve with the gravy of the fish, drawn butter.


BROILED SALT MACKEREL

Freshen by soaking it over night in water, being careful that the
skin lies uppermost. In the morning dry it without breaking, cut off
the head and tip of the tail, place it between the bars of a buttered
fish-gridiron, and broil to a light brown; lay it on a hot dish, and
dress with a little butter, pepper, and lemon juice, vinegar.


CODFISH BALLS

Put fish in cold water, set on back of stove; when water gets hot, pour
off and put cold again until fish is sufficiently fresh; then pick it
up. Boil potatoes and mash them, mix fish and potatoes together, while
potatoes are hot, taking two-thirds potatoes and one-third fish. Put in
plenty of butter; make into balls and fry in plenty of lard. Have lard
hot before putting in balls. Variation may be had by rolling each ball
in beaten egg, then in dry bread crumbs before frying.


FISH STEAKS FRIED

Cut the slices of fresh fish three-quarters of an inch thick, sprinkle
with Gold Medal Flour, or cornmeal slightly salted or dip them in eggs
lightly salted and roll in crumbs; fry a light brown. Salmon or any
other large fish can be fried this way.

CREAMED FISH

Pick (not shred) one cupful of codfish; place in a spider and fill and
cover with cold water. Stir a moment over the fire and pour off the
water. Stand on the stove, cover the fish with one and one-half pints
of milk and a large tablespoonful of butter. Stir into a cup of cold
cream two tablespoonfuls of Gold Medal Flour and when the milk on the
stove is about to boil mix this with it. When the mixture has thickened
stand where it will boil no longer and stir into it one egg. Serve at
once.


FISH CHOWDER

Two pounds of fresh white fish, a quarter of a pound of bacon, five
small potatoes, one small onion, six tomatoes, one quart of milk,
butter the size of a small hen’s egg and a teaspoon Gold Medal Flour.
Pick the fish to pieces. Remove the bone and skin; cut potatoes into
small squares; the bacon in small pieces; rub the butter and flour to
a cream. Spread in a granite kettle half of the potatoes, then half of
the fish, then sprinkle in the minced onions, then the bacon, then half
of the tomatoes. Then a shake of salt and pepper; add the rest of the
fish, tomatoes, potatoes, and more salt and pepper, using in all one
teaspoon of salt and one-fourth teaspoon of pepper. Cover with water,
let simmer for half an hour. Scald the milk, put a pinch of soda into
the chowder and stir; add the hot milk to the butter and flour; stir
smooth; then add to the chowder. Serve very hot.

FISH BALLS

The remnants of any cold fish can be used by breaking the fish to
pieces with a fork, removing all the bones and skin, and shredding
very fine. Add an equal quantity of mashed potatoes, make into a stiff
batter with a piece of butter and some milk, and a beaten egg. Flour
your hands and shape the mixture into balls. Fry in boiling lard or
drippings, to a light brown.


FISH CROQUETTES

Take remnants of boiled cod, salmon or halibut and pick the flesh out
carefully. Mince it moderately fine. Stir a piece of butter, a small
spoon Gold Medal Flour and some milk over fire until they thicken.
Then add pepper, salt and a little grated nutmeg, together with
finely-chopped parsley, and then the minced fish. When very hot remove
from the fire, turn on a dish to get cold, then shape and finish the
croquettes.


CLAMS AND RICE

Chop fine one onion and a small piece of ham or pork; add a bruised
clove of garlic, one cupful of tomatoes and a little saffron water;
stew all together for a few minutes, then add a pint of well scrubbed
small clams, still in the shell; steam a half hour in a tightly covered
dish; then add one cupful of well washed rice and about one pint of

CHAFING DISH RECIPE

Skin the fish and lay on brown paper for a few minutes. Then dip in
beaten egg and roll in finely powdered cracker crumbs.

Place butter in a chafing dish so that when melted it will cover bottom
of the dish to the depth of three-eighths of an inch. When hot place
the sardines in and cook until nicely browned, being careful not to let
them burn.

Serve on a lettuce leaf with mayonnaise dressing.


SARDINE BALLS

Pick required number of sardines into fine pieces, season to taste with
salt, pepper and onion juice. Make into small balls, handling as little
as possible. When the chafing dish (or saucepan) is hot, butter the
balls enough to prevent sticking, place in pan, and shake gently for a
few minutes until brown. Serve hot.


SHRIMP

Have a pint of shelled shrimps. Then make a thick sauce; a heaped
teaspoonful Gold Medal Flour, half an ounce butter and a quarter pint
of milk. Flavor it with a little mace, pepper and salt. Stir in the
shrimps. When well heated pour the whole out onto a hot dish, trim the
dish round with cold boiled rice, and serve.

SARDINES a la CAMBRIDGE

Take a can of good sardines (“Mustard”), remove the backbone and
outside skin and rub the meat through a sieve; mix with it minced raw
oysters, the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, a tiny dust of paprika,
three ounces of fresh bread crumbs, one and a half ounces of warm
butter, and the liquor from the oysters, and the yolks of two raw eggs.
Divide the mixture into portions about the size of walnuts, roll each
up in Gold Medal Flour and dip into beaten egg and then into freshly
made bread crumbs, and put into a frying basket and fry for three or
four minutes in clean boiling fat. Dish up in a pile on a hot dish on a
dish paper, and serve hot. Garnish with a little fresh parsley around
the dish.

Remove the skin from a can of sardines and place them in a pan, add a
piece of butter, a glass of white wine, a few shrimp, a dozen oysters,
a few mushrooms and a few crusts of bread fried in butter, and when all
is well cooked make the following sauce:

Place in a pan a piece of butter the size of an egg and melt, then add
a spoonful Gold Medal Flour and when brown, half a glass of the above
mixture except the fish; use a wooden spoon. When the sauce is made,
add the yolk of an egg and take from the fire. Place the fish in a
dish, spread on the sauce, and put in a warm oven for fifteen minutes
and serve.

SCALLOPED SARDINES

One can of sardines, one cupful of sauce (as below), five or six soda
crackers. Pick the fish over, removing back-bone and tail, and flake
with a fork. Place a layer of the sardines in an agate baking dish,
cover with the sauce, then a layer of the cracker crumbs, another layer
of sardines, and so on until the fish is all used. Cover the top layer
with cracker crumbs and bake in a hot oven until brown. Prepare the
fish sauce as follows:

SAUCE—Two tablespoonfuls each of Gold Medal Flour, butter, cup hot
milk, salt and pepper to taste. Melt the butter in sauce-pan until it
bubbles, then add the flour, salt and pepper until smooth, and pour the
hot milk in gradually, stirring each time. Cook until it thickens. This
is a good sauce to serve with any fish.


LOBSTER NEWBURG

Season one pint diced lobster with half teaspoon salt, dash cayenne,
pinch nutmeg. Put in sauce-pan with two tablespoons butter; heat
slowly. Add two tablespoons sherry; cook six minutes; add one-half cup
cream beaten with yolks two eggs, stir till thickened. Take quickly
from fire.


STEWED MUSSELS

Take about five dozen good-sized mussels, clean and then boil them
until shells open. Put very little water on when boiling them, for when
they are heated they let out plenty of juice themselves. When they are
cooked take from shell and pick over. Put in a saucepan a piece of
butter and some onions; fry until brown and add the mussels, a can of
tomatoes and two cupfuls of the juice and stew all together for about
fifteen minutes. Salt and pepper to taste, and lastly thicken the gravy
with some Gold Medal Flour dissolved in cold water.


DEVILED CRAB

One cup crab meat, picked from shells of well-boiled crabs, two
tablespoons fine bread crumbs or rolled crackers, yolk two hard-boiled
eggs, chopped juice of a lemon, one-half teaspoon mustard, a little
cayenne pepper and salt, one cup good drawn butter. Mix one spoon
crumbs with chopped crab meat, yolks, seasoning, drawn butter. Fill
scallop shells—large clam shell will do—with mixture; sift crumbs over
top, heat to slight brown in quick oven.


CREAMED CRAB

Melt a half inch slice butter, add half a cup Gold Medal Flour, stir
all the time; to this add three cups of milk and one cup of cream;
season with salt, red pepper and one tablespoonful Worcestershire
sauce. Cook ten minutes. Add the picked meat of three crabs and a small
bottle of mushrooms. Let it come to a boil once. Serve in ramikins.


CLAM CHOWDER

Twenty-five clams, chopped—not fine—one-half pound salt pork chopped
fine, six potatoes sliced thin, four onions sliced thin. Put pork in
kettle; after cooking a short time add potatoes, onions and juice of
clams. Cook two and one-half hours, then add clams; fifteen minutes
before serving add two quarts of milk.

Poultry and Game


ROAST TURKEY

Carefully pluck the bird and singe off the down with lighted paper;
break the leg bone close to the foot, hang up the bird and draw out the
strings of the thigh. Never cut the breast; make a small slit down the
back of the neck and take out the crop that way, then cut the neck bone
close, and after the bird is stuffed the skin can be turned over the
back and the crop will look full and round. Cut around the vent, making
the hole as small as possible, and draw carefully, taking care that
the gall bag and the intestines joining the gizzard are not broken.
Open the gizzard, take out the contents and detach the liver from the
gall bladder. The liver, gizzard and heart, if used in the gravy, will
need to be boiled an hour and a half and chopped as fine as possible.
Wash the turkey and wipe thoroughly dry, inside and out; then fill the
inside with stuffing, and sew the skin of the neck over the back. Sew
up the opening at the vent, then run a long skewer into the pinion and
thigh through the body, passing it through the opposite pinion and
thigh. Put a skewer in the small part of the leg, close on the outside
and push it through. Pass a string over the points of the skewers and
tie it securely at the back.

Sprinkle well with Gold Medal Flour, cover the breast with
nicely-buttered white paper, place on a grating in the dripping-pan and
put in the oven to roast. Baste every fifteen minutes—a few times with
butter and water, and then with the gravy in the dripping-pan. Do not
have too hot an oven. A turkey weighing ten pounds will require three
hours to bake.


ROAST GOOSE

Get a goose that is not more than eight months old, and the fatter it
is the more juicy the meat. The dressing should be made of three pints
of bread crumbs, six ounces of butter, a teaspoonful each of sage,
black pepper and salt and chopped onions. Don’t stuff very full, but
sew very closely so that the fat will not get in. Place in a baking
pan with a little water, and baste often with a little salt, water and
vinegar. Turn the goose frequently so that it may be evenly browned.
Bake about 2½ hours. When done, take it from the pan, drain off the fat
and add the chopped giblets, which have previously been boiled tender,
together with the water in which they were done. Thicken with Gold
Medal Flour and butter rubbed together; let boil, and serve.


BAKED CHICKEN

Take a plump chicken, dress and lay in cold salt water for half hour,
put in pan, stuff and sprinkle with salt and pepper; lay a few slices
of fat pork. Cover and bake until tender, with a steady fire. Baste
often. Turn so as to have uniform heat.


CHICKEN—SOUTHERN STYLE

Wash your chicken thoroughly in soda and water. Dry and disjoint. Put
one and one-half cups of cold water in a porcelain pot (Dutch oven
preferred); pack chicken in closely. Mince two small onions, one kernel
garlic, little parsley and sprinkle over chicken. Cover closely and let
simmer for three hours. One-half hour before done season with salt and
pepper. Don’t lift cover during the cooking. When done remove chicken
and thicken gravy with a little Gold Medal Flour.

WILD DUCKS

Nearly all wild ducks are liable to have a fishy flavor, and when
handled by inexperienced cooks, are sometimes uneatable from this
cause. Before roasting them guard against this by parboiling them
with a small carrot, peeled, put within each. This will absorb the
unpleasant taste. An onion will have the same effect; but unless you
mean to use onion in the stuffing, the carrot is preferable.


ROAST WILD DUCK

Parboil as above directed; throw away the carrot or onion, lay in fresh
water one-half of an hour; stuff with bread crumbs, season with pepper,
sage, salt and onion, roast until brown, basting for half the time
with butter and water, then with drippings. Add to the gravy, when you
have taken up the ducks, a teaspoonful of currant jelly and a pinch of
cayenne pepper. Thicken with browned flour and serve in a tureen.


PIGEON PIE

Clean and truss three or four pigeons, rub outside with a mixture
of pepper and salt; rub inside with a bit of butter, fill with a
bread-and-butter stuffing, or mashed potatoes; sew up the slit, butter
the sides of a tin basin or pudding dish, and line (the sides only)
with pie paste, rolled to quarter of an inch thickness; lay the birds
in; for three large tame pigeons, cut quarter of a pound of sweet
butter and put it over them, strew over a large teaspoonful of salt and
a small teaspoonful of pepper, with finely cut parsley; dredge a large
teaspoonful of Gold Medal Flour over; put in water to nearly fill the
pie; lay skewers across the top, cover with a puff paste crust; cut a
slit in the middle, ornament the edge with leaves, braids, or shells
of paste, and put in a moderately hot or quick oven for one hour; when
nearly done brush the top over with the yolk of an egg beaten with a
little milk, and finish. The pigeons for this pie may be cut in two or
more pieces, if preferred. Any small birds may be done in this manner.


ROAST PIGEON

Clean and truss two young pigeons, mince the liver, and mix with them
two ounces of finely grated bread crumbs, two ounces of fresh butter,
finely chopped onion, a teaspoonful shredded parsley, a little salt,
pepper, nutmeg. Fill birds with this forcemeat, fasten a slice of fat
bacon over the breast of each, and roast. Make a sauce by mixing a
little water with the gravy which drops from the birds, and boiling
it with a little thickening; season it with pepper, salt and chopped
parsley.


QUAIL ON TOAST

Take five quail, but don’t remove the legs, for you would lose all the
taste of the game. Wipe them well; string them tight, so as to raise
the breasts. Put a little butter on each, a little lemon juice, and
inside each the quarter of a lemon without the peel. Then put a very
thin slice of pork, about two inches square, around each quail, with
two or three cuts in each side, and string it tight. Let cook on a good
fire, and when they are nearly well done, for white meat game must be
well done, cut the strings; dress nicely on toast and serve hot. Pour
the juice on the quail after having taken the fat off, and put some
slices of lemon around the dish, one for each quail.

ROAST TAME DUCK

Take a young farmyard duck fattened at liberty, but cleansed by being
shut up two or three days and fed on barley meal and water. Pluck,
singe and empty; scald the feet, skin and twist round on the back of
the bird; head, neck and pinions must be cut off, the latter at the
first joint, and all skewered firmly to give the breast a nice plump
appearance. For stuffing, one-half pound of onions, one teaspoonful
of powdered sage, three tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, the liver of
a duck parboiled and minced with cayenne pepper and salt. Cut fine
onions, throwing boiling water over them for ten minutes; drain through
a gravy strainer, and add the bread crumbs, minced liver, sage, pepper
and salt to taste; mix, and put inside the duck. This amount is for
one duck, more onion and more sage may be added, but the above is a
delicate compound not likely to disagree with the stomach. Let the
duck be hung a day or two, according to the weather, to make the flesh
tender. Roast before a brisk, clear fire, baste often, and dredge with
flour to make the bird look frothy. Serve with a good brown gravy in
the dish, and apple sauce in a tureen. It takes about an hour.

RABBIT PIE

Cut a rabbit into seven pieces, soak in salted water one-half hour and
stew until half done in enough water to cover it. Lay slices of pork in
the bottom of a pie dish and upon these a layer of rabbit. Then follow
slices of hard-boiled egg, peppered and buttered. Continue until the
dish is full, the top layer being bacon. Pour in the water in which the
rabbit was stewed, and adding a little Gold Medal Flour, cover with
puff paste, cut a slit in the middle and bake one hour, laying paper
over the top should it brown too fast.


VENISON STEAK BROILED

Take the leg and cut slices from it, having a quick, clear fire. Turn
them constantly. They should be served underdone. Butter both sides
of the steak; sprinkle salt and pepper over the venison, garnish with
parsley and accompanying it by a jelly sauce.

MEATS


ROAST PIG

Select a pig about six weeks old, wash it thoroughly inside and
outside; wipe dry with a towel, salt inside and stuff it with a rich
fowl dressing, making it plump. Sew it up, place it in the dripping
pan, salt and pepper the outside. Pour a little water into the dripping
pan, baste with butter and water a few times as the pig warms,
afterward with gravy from the dripping pan. Roast from two to three
hours. Make the gravy by skimming off most of the grease; stir in the
pan a good tablespoonful of Gold Medal Flour, turn in the water to make
it the right thickness, season and let all boil up once. Strain and
turn into the gravy dish. Place the pig upon a large platter surrounded
with parsley. Send to the table hot. In carving, cut off the head
first; split the back, take off the hams and shoulders and separate the
ribs.


BAKED HAM

Put a medium-sized ham in a pot and cover with sweet cider. Let it
simmer gently for three and one-half hours. Skim frequently to remove
the grease as it rises. When tender take out and remove the rind; cut
the fat on top into diamonds and in each diamond stick a clove; then
rub over the top of the ham one-half of a cupful of maple syrup, place
in the oven and bake slowly for forty-five minutes.


TO ROAST A LEG OF PORK

Choose a small leg of fine young pork; cut a slit in the knuckle with
a sharp knife, and fill the space with sage and onions, chopped, and a
little pepper and salt. When one-half done, score the skin in slices,
but do not cut deeper than the outer rind. Apple sauce should be served
with it.


SALT PORK, CREAM GRAVY, SOUTHERN STYLE

Cut sweet cured salt pork into half-inch slices, put into saucepan,
cover with cold water and bring to boiling point. Drain off water, add
cold water, stand a few minutes, roll in Gold Medal Flour, two parts,
corn starch, one part, mixed and seasoned with white pepper. Have
one tablespoonful of hot bacon fat in the frying pan to prevent pork
from sticking. Pour off fat as it melts while frying, brown and fry
until reduced one-half. For one and one-half cups cream gravy allow
three spoonfuls melted fat, add two level tablespoonfuls corn starch.
Cook three minutes in the hot fat without browning, then add one and
one-half cups milk, one-quarter teaspoonful salt, and cook until
smoothly thickened. Serve for breakfast with baked potatoes and hot
biscuit.


ROAST SPARE-RIB

Trim the ragged ends of a spare-rib neatly, crack the ribs across the
middle, rub with salt and sprinkle with pepper. Fold over, stuff with a
turkey dressing, sew up tightly, place in dripping pan with a pint of
water, baste often, turning it once or twice so as to bake both sides a
rich brown.


PORK CHOPS WITH TOMATO GRAVY

Trim off skin and fat; rub the chops over with a mixture of powdered
sage and onion; put small pieces butter into frying-pan; put in the
chops and cook slowly, as they should be well done. Place chops on hot
dish; add a little hot water to gravy in pan, one large spoon butter
rolled in Gold Medal Flour, pepper, salt and sugar, and one-half cup
juice drained from can tomatoes. Stew five minutes and pour over the
chops and serve.

PORK AND BEANS

Soak one quart white beans over night in cold water. Drain, add fresh
water and simmer till tender. Put in baking pan and place in center
one-half pound fat salt pork, parboiled. Mix one teaspoon salt,
one-half teaspoon mustard and one tablespoon molasses; add this to
the beans, with enough boiling water to cover. Bake eight hours in a
moderate oven, adding more water as necessary.


FILLET OF MUTTON

Cut a fillet, or round, from a leg of mutton; remove all the fat from
the edges, and take out the bone; rub it all over with a very little
pepper and salt; have ready a stuffing of finely minced onions, bread
crumbs and butter, well seasoned and mixed; fill with this the place of
the bone; make deep incisions or cuts all over the surface of the meat
and fill them closely with the same stuffing; bind a piece of cloth
around the meat to keep it in shape, and stew with just enough water to
cover it; let it cook slowly and steadily from four to six hours, in
proportion to its size and toughness, skimming frequently. When done,
serve with its own gravy.


SHOULDER OF VEAL

Remove the bone, and fill the space it occupied with a dressing made
as for turkey or chicken; keep well basted and proceed as with above.
A fillet of veal may be prepared in the same way, by removing the leg
bone with a sharp knife.


TO FRY TRIPE

Cut in pieces convenient for serving; beat an egg lightly and dip each
piece in the egg. Have your frying-pan hot and fry brown in butter. It
will take a good deal of butter to make it nice and keep from burning.


BEEF OMELET

One and one-half pounds of good beefsteak chopped fine, one cup suet,
two slices of wheat bread soaked in water, two eggs and half a cup of
sweet cream; season well with salt and pepper. Mold into a loaf or roll
and bake three-fourths of an hour, basting frequently.


ROAST BEEF

To roast in a cooking stove, the fire must have careful attention
lest the meat should burn. Lay it, well-floured, and seasoned, into a
dripping pan, with rather more than enough water to cover the bottom;
turn the pan around often, that all parts may be equally roasted, and
baste frequently. The oven should be quite hot when the beef is first
put in that the outside may cool quickly and thus retain the juices. A
large roast of eight or ten pounds is much better and more economical
than a small one, even in a small family. Allow a quarter of an hour
for every pound of meat if you like it rare. It can be re-roasted on
the next day. If much remains serve cold on the next, or in very thin
slices; dip each one in flour, then chop two onions fine, place a layer
of meat in a baking dish and sprinkle it with salt, pepper and onion;
above this place a layer of sliced or canned tomatoes; alternate the
layers till the dish is nearly full, moisten with the gravy, place a
layer of tomatoes upon the top, fill with boiling water, cover with a
plate and bake two hours.

ROAST LOIN OF VEAL

Leave in the kidney, around which put considerable salt. Make a
dressing the same as for fowls; unroll the loin, put the stuffing well
around the kidney, fold and secure with several coils of white cotton
twine wound around in all directions; place in a dripping pan, with the
thick side down, and put in a rather hot oven, letting it cool down to
moderate; in one-half hour add a little hot water to the pan, and baste
often; after half an hour turn over the roast and when done sprinkle
lightly with Gold Medal Flour and baste with melted butter. Before
serving carefully remove the twine. A roast of four or five pounds will
bake in about two hours. For a gravy skim off some of the fat if there
is too much in the drippings; dredge in Gold Medal Flour; stir until
brown, add hot water if necessary; boil a few minutes, stir in sweet
herbs as fancied and put in a gravy boat. Serve with green peas and
lemon jelly.


ENTREE OF VEAL

Take a piece of butter the size of an egg, three pounds of raw veal,
one teaspoonful salt, one of pepper and two eggs. Chop fine and mix
together, adding two tablespoonfuls of water. Mold this into a loaf,
then roll into two tablespoonfuls of pounded crackers and bake two
hours. When cold, slice.

FRIED SWEETBREADS

For every mode of dressing they should be prepared by half boiling, and
then putting them in cold water; this makes them whiter and firmer.
Dip in beaten egg and then in bread crumbs, pepper and salt and fry in
lard. Serve with peas or tomatoes.


VEAL CUTLETS, BREADED

Trim and flatten the cutlets, add pepper and salt, and roll in beaten
egg, then in cracker crumbs. Fry in good dripping, turn when the lower
side is brown. Drain off the fat, squeeze a little lemon juice upon
each, and serve in a hot flat dish.


CALVES LIVER AND BACON

Cut liver in one-half inch slices, soak in cold water twenty minutes,
drain, dry and roll in Gold Medal Flour. Have pan very hot. Put in
bacon thinly sliced, turn until brown; put on hot platter. Fry liver
quickly in the hot fat, turning very often. When done, pour off all
but one or two tablespoons fat, dredge in Gold Medal Flour until it is
absorbed, and stir till brown. Add hot water gradually to make smooth
gravy, season and boil one minute. Serve separately.

VEAL LOAF

Three pounds chopped veal, one pound fresh pork chopped fine, three
well beaten eggs, butter size of an egg, one pint of bread crumbs, 1
tablespoon of salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper, one-half teaspoon each of
thyme and sage. Make into loaf, take piece of white muslin and wrap
securely, also the ends. Place in a baking pan with very little water.
Baste often. Turn so as to brown both sides. Leave in cloth until cold.


BEEFSTEAK AND ONIONS

Take thick beefsteak (that which is not so tender will answer), cut it
in pieces ready to serve; put into a spider with a little hot water;
slice up three or four onions, and stew very slowly several hours. Let
the water boil out and the meat become brown, then stir flour into the
fat which has come from the meat. If there is too much, take some out
and pour on boiling water, and stir until the flour is cooked. Pour the
meat and gravy into a deep dish or platter and serve. Pieces of cold
roast or steak can be used.

Bay leaves, which can be obtained at the druggist’s, are a good
substitute for those who do not like onions, but the leaves should be
taken out before sending to the table.


BROILED STEAK

Select your steak carefully. The wide end of the slice of “Porterhouse”
is nice, or the “loin.” Have the gridiron hot and buttered, and over
hot coals; place the beef upon the gridiron, and cook till the blood
begins to start upon the upper side before turning, if the fire is not
too hot. To retain the juice, beef should be cooked rapidly at first.
Turn frequently rather than scorch. When done, remove to the platter
and season to the taste. Use no salt while cooking. This prevents the
blood from escaping. Serve with mushrooms.


BEEFSTEAK ROLL

Select a nice, tender, sirloin steak; pound it well, season with salt
and pepper; then make a nice dressing of chopped bread, well buttered,
salted and peppered, with a little sage, and mixed together with a
very little warm water. Spread this on the meat, then begin at one end
and roll it together; tie with strings. Put into a dripping pan with a
little water. Bake about three-quarters of an hour. To be eaten warm,
or sliced cold for tea.


SPICED VEAL

Chop three pounds of veal steak and one thick slice of salt pork, as
fine as sausage meat; add to it three Boston crackers, rolled fine;
half a teacup of tomato catsup, three well-beaten eggs, one and
one-half teaspoons of salt, one teaspoon of pepper, and one grated
lemon; mould it in the form of a loaf of bread, put it into a small
dripping pan, cover with one rolled cracker, and baste with a teacupful
of hot water and two tablespoons of butter. Bake three hours, basting
very often.


CREAMED DRIED BEEF

Pick in small pieces one-fourth of a pound of thinly-cut rather moist
dried beef and brown in a little butter. When brown pour in it a
coffecupful of milk and cream. Let it come to a boil and slightly
thicken with a little butter and Gold Medal Flour creamed together.
When it boils, pour it over a platter of brown toast and serve it at
once.

BEEF BALL

Three pounds choice beef (rare) chopped fine, ten butter crackers
crushed thoroughly, half teacup butter, pepper and salt to taste, half
cup water. Mix all well together, press down hard in pans, dip a few
spoonfuls of the water in which the beef was boiled over the top, and
bake one and a half or two hours. Slice when cold.


VEAL OR LAMB PATTIES

Use cold veal or lamb; chop fine, taking equal parts of meat and bread
crumbs; season with sage, salt and pepper, and moisten with eggs and
melted butter, or gravies from the meat; make into little cakes, and
fry in butter till well browned.


VEAL LOAF

Three pounds of veal, one and one-half pounds of salt pork, both
chopped fine; two pounded crackers, two eggs well beaten, one nutmeg,
two teaspoons of pepper, two teaspoons of chopped parsley, two
teaspoons of celery, and the rind and juice of one lemon. Put batter on
the loaf after kneading. Bake in


TO BOIL CORNED BEEF

Wash it thoroughly and put into a pot that will hold plenty of water;
the water should be cold; skim with great care; allow forty minutes for
every pound after it has begun to boil. The goodness depends much on
its being boiled gently and long. If it is to be eaten cold, lay it in
a vessel which will admit of its being pressed with a heavy weight, as
salt meat is very much improved by pressing.


MUTTON CHOPS

Trim off the superfluous fat, and broil over a bright fire; season and
butter them when cooked; do not have them rare. They can also be fried
by first dredging with flour or bread crumbs.


BAKED TONGUE

Season with common salt, a very little saltpetre, half a cup of brown
sugar, pepper, cloves, mace and allspice, powdered fine. Let it remain
for a fortnight, then take out the tongue, put it in a pan; lay on some
butter; cover with bread crumbs, and bake slowly till so tender that
a straw will easily go through it. To be eaten cold. Will keep a long
time, and is very nice for tea.


FRIED LIVER

Cut it in slices, and lay in cold salt water to draw out the blood.
Some place it over a slow fire till the liver turns white. Take it out,
roll each piece in flour or bread crumbs, season and put in hot lard.
Cover, and cook slowly, till the liver is tender, then uncover and fry
quickly till brown. Another way is to pour boiling water on the liver
for a few moments, and proceed as above.


IRISH STEW

Take five or six mutton chops; the same quantity of beef, veal and
pork; six or eight Irish potatoes, peeled and quartered; three or four
onions sliced, and salt and pepper to taste; add a pint of good gravy,
flavored with catsup, if liked. Cover all very closely, and let it
simmer slowly for two hours (never allowing it to stop simmering). A
slice or two of ham is an improvement. Stir occasionally to prevent
burning.

BOILED BEEF’S TONGUE

Boil a medium sized tongue three hours, or until so tender a broom corn
will go through it easily; skim frequently when it begins to boil. When
first removed from the fire skin it and set away to cool. If a pickled
tongue, the water should be cold when put on to boil; if a fresh one
salt thoroughly half an hour before taking it up.


HASH ON TOAST

Cold pieces of beefsteak are nice, chopped fine, cooked in a little
butter and water, and thickened with flour; pour over pieces of toast
laid on a platter, and moisten with hot water, salted. Garnish with
hard-boiled eggs.


HASH, WITH POTATOES

Cold pieces of beef, either boiled, broiled or baked, can be used for
the dish. Free the meat from all pieces of bone, chop fine, and mix
with two parts of potatoes to one of beef. Potatoes boiled with the
skins on are best. They should be cold, and chopped not quite so fine
as the meat. Put them in a spider with melted butter or clarified
drippings, and just enough hot water to keep from burning. Season to
taste, and keep stirring till the whole is cooked together. If liked
crisp, let it remain still long enough to bake a crust on the bottom,
and then turn out on a flat dish. Other meats may be used instead of
beef.

TO ROAST A SHOULDER OF MUTTON

Season and roast the same as beef, basting with butter and water till
there is gravy enough to use. It requires to be cooked more than beef.
Serve with currant jelly.


SOUSE

Clean pigs’ feet and ears thoroughly, and soak them a number of days in
salt and water; boil them very tender and split open. (They are good
fried.) To souse them cold, pour boiling vinegar over them, spiced with
pepper corns and a little salt. They will keep good, pickled, for a
month or two.


LAMB WITH RICE

Partly roast a small fore-quarter of lamb; cut it in pieces, and lay in
a dish; season, and pour over a little water; boil a pint of rice till
dry, salt it, and stir in a piece of butter, also the yolks of four
well-beaten eggs, only reserving enough to put over the top; spread the
rice and the remainder of the eggs over the lamb, to form a covering;
bake a light brown.


TO GLAZE HAM

The ham should be a cold boiled one, from which the skin was removed
when hot. Cover the ham all over with beaten egg; make a thick paste of
cream, pounded cracker, salt and a teaspoonful of melted butter. Spread
this evenly over the ham and brown in a moderate oven.

BEEF’S HEART STUFFED

After washing the heart thoroughly cut it into dice one-half inch long;
put into a saucepan with water enough to cover. Remove scum. When
nearly done add a sliced onion, a stalk of celery chopped fine, pepper
and salt and a piece of butter. Stew until the meat is very tender.
Stir up a tablespoonful of Gold Medal Flour with a small quantity of
water and thicken the whole. Boil up and serve.


BEEF STEWED WITH ONIONS

Cut two pounds of tender beef into small pieces, season with pepper and
salt; slice one or two onions and add to it, with water enough to make
a gravy. Let it stew slowly, till the beef is thoroughly cooked, then
add some pieces of butter rolled in Gold Medal Flour, enough to make
a rich gravy. Cold beef may be cooked in the same way, but the onions
must then be cooked before adding them to the meat. Add more boiling
water if it dries too fast.


BEEF TIMBALES

Free left-over meat from fat and gristle, put through meat chopper,
cutting finely. To one pint of meal add one teaspoonful of salt,
one-eighth teaspoonful of pepper, put one-half cup of stock or water,
two tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs and one tablespoonful of butter
together in a saucepan over the simmering burner; when hot, add to it
the meat; take from the fire and stir in carefully two whole eggs,
well beaten. Put mixture in buttered custard or timbale cups, stand in
baking pan half filled with hot water. Bake in moderate oven fifteen to
twenty minutes. Serve with tomato sauce.


FRIED TRIPE

Should be washed in warm water and cut into squares of three inches;
take one egg, three tablespoonfuls of Gold Medal Flour, a little salt
and make a thick batter by adding milk; fry out some slices of pork,
dip the tripe into the batter and fry a light brown.


TRIPE STEW

Melt in stew kettle two tablespoonfuls lard, one of butter; add three
medium-sized onions, three cloves and garlic, all chopped very fine;
one cup chopped greens, a little parsley; one-quart can strained
tomatoes, a pinch of dried mushrooms, if handy; pepper and salt to suit
taste; six large potatoes cut in quarters, lastly, three pounds plain
boiled tripe cut in thin strips. Add boiling water if too dry. Serve
hot.


HASH

Take cold pieces of beef that have been left over and chop them fine;
then add cold boiled potatoes chopped fine; add pepper and salt and a
little warm water; put all in a frying-pan and cook slowly for about
twenty minutes.


BEEF A LA MODE

Take a piece of meat, cross-rib is best, put a slice of bacon or some
lard in the bottom of pot, then the meat, and fill up with water till
the meat is covered; then take two onions, some pepper-corns, cloves,
bay leaves, one carrot and a crust of brown bread, salt and some
vinegar; pepper, sprinkle flour over top and boil slowly.

OX-TAIL SAUTE

About twenty cents worth of ox-tail for three people. Have them
disjointed in pieces about an inch long. Take one large onion and brown
in butter, one carrot, one turnip, one small piece of garlic, enough
water to cover and cook slowly for four hours.


BOILED BEEF WITH CABBAGE—German Style

Take one head of cabbage, and after removing all soiled and bruised
leaves, cut in sections lengthwise making about eight or nine pieces,
leaving the piece of heart attached to each piece to hold it together.
Place in the kettle on top of beef, which has been boiling some time;
boil together for one hour. Salt to taste and pepper. Lift out the
meat, let the cabbage boil a few moments longer in the beef broth and
send it to the table.


HOT BEEF LOAF

Take three pounds of steak from the round and grind it through a
chopper. Beat two eggs, pepper and salt, one and one-half of fresh,
soft bread crumbs. Press this into a shallow, oblong, tin loaf-shaped
pan and cover with about eight slices of salt pork, cut thin. Add
one-half cupful of water to the pan, bake an hour, basting often, then
put in on a warm platter, removing pieces of pork. Thicken the gravy in
the pan with a little Gold Medal Flour, and one-half canful of stewed
mushrooms; pour over and around the meat and serve hot. It is good when
cold if cut in slices and served with lettuce salad.


BEEF PIE WITH POTATO CRUST

When you have used the best of a cold roast of beef take the small
pieces, or as much as will half fill a granite baking pan; also any
gravy, a lump of butter, a bit of sliced onion, pepper and salt, and
enough water to make plenty of gravy; put over a fire, thicken by
dredging in a tablespoonful of Gold Medal Flour; cover it up where it
may stew gently. Now boil a sufficient quantity of potatoes to fill up
your baking dish, mash smooth and beat light with milk and butter and
lace in a thick layer on top of meat. Brush it over with egg, place
the dish in an oven and let remain long enough to become brown. There
should be a goodly quantity of gravy left with the beef, that the dish
be not dry and tasteless.


ROLLED STEAK

Take a good rump steak, flatten and lay upon it a seasoning made of
bread crumbs, parsley, pepper and salt, mixed with butter beaten to a
cream. Roll up the steak, bind it evenly, and lay it in a dish with a
cup of boiling water. Cover with another dish and bake forty minutes,
baste often.

CAPER SAUCE

Two tablespoonfuls butter, one tablespoonful Gold Medal Flour; mix
well; pour on boiling water till it thickens; and one hard-boiled egg,
chopped fine, and two tablespoonfuls of capers.


GIBLET SAUCE

Take the liver, heart, gizzard and neck of a chicken, wash and boil in
salted water. Let boil till tender. Take them out with a skimmer and
chop into coarse pieces. Put them back, add a little butter and thicken
to a cream. Pepper and salt, boil a few minutes and serve.


SAUCE ROBERT

One cup brown sauce made with stock, one teaspoonful sugar, one
teaspoonful mustard, one tablespoonful vinegar. Simmer five minutes.


TOMATO MUSTARD

One peck of ripe tomatoes, boiled with two onions, six red peppers,
four cloves of garlic, for one hour; then add a half pint or half
pound salt, three tablespoonfuls black pepper, half ounce each ginger,
allspice, mace, cloves; boil again for one hour longer, and when cold
add one pint of vinegar and a quarter pound of mustard; and if you like
it very hot, a tablespoonful of cayenne.


MINT SAUCE

Mix one tablespoonful of white sugar to a half teacupful of good
vinegar; add the mint and let it infuse for half an hour in a cool
place before sending to the table. Serve with roast lamb or mutton.


CELERY SAUCE

Mix two tablespoonfuls Gold Medal Flour with half teacupful butter,
have ready a pint of boiling milk; stir the flour and butter into the
milk; take three heads of celery, cut into small bits and boil for a
few minutes in water, which strain off; put the celery into the melted
butter and keep stirred over the fire for five or ten minutes. This is
very nice with boiled fowl or turkey.


CURRANT JELLY SAUCE

Melt one-half glass currant jelly over slow fire. Add one cup hot brown
sauce; stir well and simmer one minute.


CREAM OR WHITE SAUCE

One cupful milk, a teaspoonful Gold Medal Flour and a tablespoonful of
butter, salt and pepper. Heat butter in pan when hot, but not brown,
add the flour. Stir until smooth; gradually add the milk. Let it boil
up once. Season with salt and pepper and serve. This is nice to cut
cold potatoes into and let them heat through. They are then creamed
potatoes. It also answers as a sauce for other vegetables, omelets,
fish and sweetbreads, or, indeed, for anything that requires a white
sauce. If you have plenty of cream, use it, and omit the butter.


HOLLANDAISE SAUCE

Cream one-half cup butter. Add four well-beaten egg yolks, then the
juice of one-half of a lemon, one-half teaspoonful of salt and a dash
of cayenne. Pour a cupful of hot water in slowly. Mix and set in a
saucepan of hot water. Stir until the sauce becomes a thick cream. Do
not allow it to boil. Stir a few minutes after removing from the fire.
It is a fine sauce for fish, asparagus or cauliflower.

MUSHROOM SAUCE

Dissolve one-half teaspoonful of extract of beef in one-half pint of
boiling water. Fry one minced onion and one chopped carrot in a little
butter or dripping until lightly browned; pour the liquid over them,
let all boil together for ten minutes and add a dessert-spoonful of
mushroom ketchup, skim, strain, and it is ready for the table.

EGGS


HAM AND EGGS

Fry the ham quickly; remove from the pan as soon as done. Drop the
eggs, one at a time, into the hot fat; be careful not to let the yolks
break and run, and keep the eggs as much separated as possible, to
preserve their shape. The ham should be cut in pieces the right size to
serve and, when the eggs are done, one should be laid on each piece of
ham. If any eggs remain, they can be placed uniformly on the edge of
the platter.


CURRIED EGGS

Slice two onions and fry in butter, add a tablespoonful curry powder
and one pint good broth or stock, stew till onions are quite tender,
add a cupful of cream thickened with arrowroot or rice flour, simmer a
few moments, then add eight or ten hard-boiled eggs, cut in slices and
beat them well, but do not boil.


OMELET SOUFFLE

Take three eggs, two ounces of butter, one dessert-spoonful of chopped
parsley, one salt-spoonful of chopped onions, one pinch of dried herbs.
Beat the whites of the eggs to a very stiff froth; mix the yolks with
the parsley and a little salt and pepper. Stir the herbs gently into
them and continue as in a plain omelet. Fold the omelet and serve
immediately.


OMELET

Six eggs, whites and yolks, beaten separately; half pint of milk,
teaspoonful corn starch, one teaspoonful baking powder, and a little
salt; the whites, beaten to a stiff froth, last; cook in a little
butter.


SPANISH OMELET

Mince very fine enough ham, fat as well as lean, as will fill a small
teacup and add two finely-chopped small onions, such as are used for
pickling. Beat six eggs, stir the ham into them and fry the omelet the
usual way, folding it over when done.


SCRAMBLED EGGS

  3 eggs,
  ½ teaspoonful salt,
  ⅓ cup milk or water,
  Sprinkle with pepper,
  1 teaspoonful butter.

Beat the eggs slightly, add the milk and seasoning. Cook in a hot,
buttered frying pan, stirring constantly until thick. Serve hot.


OMELET AU NATURAL

Break eight or ten eggs into a basin; add a little salt and pepper,
with a tablespoonful of water; beat the whole well with a spoon or
whisk. In the meantime put some fresh butter into an omelet pan, and
when it is nearly hot, put in an omelet; while it is frying, with a
skimmer spoon raise the edge from the pan that it may be properly done.
When the eggs are set and one side is a fine brown, double it half over
and serve hot. These omelets should be put quite thin in the pan; the
butter required for each will be about the size of a small egg.

EGGS A LA MODE

Remove skin from ten tomatoes, medium size, cut in a saucepan, add
butter, pepper and salt; when sufficiently boiled, beat up five or six
eggs, and just before you serve turn them into the saucepan with the
tomatoes, and stir them one way for two minutes, allowing them time to
be well cooked.


OMELET

Six eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately. One cupful milk, one
tablespoonful of butter melted in the milk, one tablespoonful of Gold
Medal Flour; cook slowly in a buttered skillet, on top of the stove,
without stirring.


POACHED OR DROPPED EGGS

Fill a pan with boiling, salted water. Break each egg into a wet saucer
and slip it into the water; set the pan back where water will not boil.
Dip the water over the eggs with a spoon. When the white is firm and
a film has formed over the yolk, they are cooked. Take them up with a
skimmer, drain and serve hot, on toast. Season with salt.


EGGS AND BACON

Cut eight slices of bacon very thin, and fry until crisp; take them out
and keep hot in the oven. Break four eggs separately into the boiling
fat and fry until brown. Serve with the eggs laid over the bacon, and
small fried pieces of bread placed round. Hash may be used instead of
bacon.


POACHED EGGS

Have the water boiling, and the toast moistened in a little salt water,
and buttered. Break the eggs, one by one, carefully into the water, let
them boil till the white sets, remove with an egg slice, pare off the
ragged edges and lay each egg upon a slice of toast; put over bits of
butter, salt and pepper. Eggs require to be quite fresh to poach nicely.


EGGS A LA CARACAS

Chop finely two ounces smoked dried beef freed from the fat and
outside skin. Add one cupful tomatoes, one-fourth cupful grated Old
English cheese, a few drops of onion juice and a few grains each of
cinnamon and cayenne. Melt two tablespoonfuls butter, add mixture and
when heated, add three eggs slightly beaten. Cook until of a creamy
consistency, stirring continually and scraping from bottom of pan.


CURRIED EGGS

Boil eight eggs hard, and cut into thick slices. Cook together in a
saucepan a tablespoonful of butter and a heaping tablespoonful of Gold
Medal Flour into which has been stirred a teaspoonful of curry powder.
Stir until smooth, then add a large cupful of skimmed soup stock and
cook, stirring all the time, to a smooth sauce. If too thick, add more
stock. When smooth and of the consistency of cream, add salt and pepper
to taste and lay into the sauce the sliced eggs, sprinkled lightly with
salt. Cook until very hot.

SHIRRED EGGS

Butter an egg shirred or small vegetable dish, cover bottom and side
with fine bread crumbs. Add an egg very carefully, cover with seasoned
bread crumbs, and bake in a slow oven until white is firm and crumbs
are brown.


FRIED EGGS

Fried eggs are cooked as buttered eggs without being turned. They are
usually fried with bacon fat, which is taken by spoonfuls and poured
over the eggs. Do not have the fat too hot as that will give the egg a
hard, indigestible crust.


BUTTERED EGGS

Melt one tablespoonful of butter, slip in an egg and cook until the
white is firm. Turn over once while cooking, and use just enough butter
to keep it from sticking.


BREAD OMELET

  2 tablespoonfuls bread crumbs,
  1 speck salt,
  1 speck pepper,
  2 tablespoonfuls milk,
  1 egg,
  ½ teaspoonful butter.

Soak the bread crumbs in the milk for fifteen minutes, then add the
salt and pepper. Separate the yolk and the white of the egg and beat
until light. Add the yolk to the bread and milk and cut in the white.
Turn in the heated buttered pan and cook until set. Fold and turn on
heated dish.


ASPARAGUS OMELET

  Omelet,
  1 cup white sauce,
  1 can asparagus.

Follow any of the above omelet recipes. Make white sauce. Add
asparagus, drained and rinsed, to the white sauce, spread some of the
mixture over half of the baked omelet, fold over the other half, turn
on platter and pour over the rest of the sauce. Use the cut asparagus.
Cooked peas, cauliflower, or remnants of finely chopped cooked chicken,
veal or ham may be used in place of the asparagus.


EGGS AND TOMATOES

Scrambled eggs with tomatoes make an appetizing luncheon dish. Take two
good-sized tomatoes, peel, cut them in pieces, and fry them in a little
hot olive oil. When cooked drain off the liquid and take four eggs well
beaten, add some cream, and scramble. Mix the tomatoes with the eggs,
seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. Serve on thin slices of toast.


EGGS AND SPAGHETTI

Take spaghetti and cook it with a cupful of grated cheese. When the
spaghetti and cheese are cooked, add slices of hard-boiled eggs. Serve
in a bowl garnished with pieces of soft toast.

Among many other excellent dishes made with this paste are fried
chicken with spaghetti and tomato jelly and macaroni au gratin in an
Edam cheese case.


EGGS IN BAKED POTATOES

  6 eggs,
  6 potatoes,
  6 tablespoonfuls grated cheese,
  6 tablespoonfuls butter.

Bake the potatoes, cut off the top and remove half of the inside
of potato, in its place drop an egg raw, salt, cayenne pepper, 1
teaspoonful cheese in each and 1 teaspoonful butter. Put back into a
hot oven for 4 minutes.

VEGETABLES


SWEET POTATOES—Southern Style

  4 boiled sweet potatoes,
  ¼ pound butter,
  1 tablespoonful water,
  Lemon juice,
  ¼ cup brown sugar.

Skin boiled potatoes and quarter. Place in baking dish, with butter on
top; sprinkle with the brown sugar; add the water and a little lemon
juice. Brown in oven and serve hot.


GLAZED SWEET POTATOES

  6 medium sized potatoes,
  ½ cup sugar,
  ¼ cup water,
  3 tablespoonfuls butter.

Wash and pare potatoes. Cook ten minutes in boiling, salted water.
Drain, cut in halves lengthwise, and put in a buttered pan. Make a
syrup by boiling three minutes the sugar and water; add butter. Brush
potatoes with syrup and bake 15 minutes, beating twice with remaining
syrup.


SPINACH WITHOUT WATER

The following method is very little known and has the advantages of
preserving all the nutriment in the spinach and avoiding the use of
boiling water.

Having washed and drained the spinach very thoroughly, cut it up in
coarse pieces and put it in a saucepan in which you have heated three
and a half ounces of butter to every pound of spinach. Add salt, grated
nutmeg and cook sharply.


SPINACH “AU NATURAL”

Having cooked the spinach in salt water as before, wash and drain the
leaves carefully, then remove all water and give them a few strokes
with the knife without chopping them up. Put them into a frying pan in
which you have heated some butter; salt to taste and serve very hot.

This method of preparing spinach is very much appreciated in Italy,
where they add filets of anchovies to it.


DUCHESSE POTATOES

  Mashed potatoes,
  1 egg.

Take freshly boiled and mashed potatoes or some that are left over,
add to them the beaten yolk of egg, place in a greased tin and form in
balls, hearts or flat cakes, brush with the beaten white, and brown in
oven.


POTATOES WITH CHEESE

Hash eight cold boiled potatoes, mix them with one-half cupful of
cream, half an ounce of good butter, a pinch of salt and pepper and a
very small dash of grated nutmeg. Place them in a dish, sprinkle over
them two tablespoonfuls of grated American cheese, two tablespoonfuls
of grated bread crumbs, a large teaspoonful of melted butter, and brown
in the oven for ten minutes.


BAKED PEPPERS

Cold rice and stewed tomatoes can be made into a delicate filling for
peppers by seasoning highly with spices and a little onion. These can
either be baked directly or can first be fried in hot butter or olive
oil, then put in a baking dish covered with a cupful of white stock
and baked for half an hour or more. All baked peppers are better when
cooked in stock.

LYONNAISE POTATOES (No. 1)

Cook one onion thickly sliced in three tablespoonfuls butter until
delicately browned. Remove onion and keep in a warm place. Add three
cups cold boiled potatoes, cut in slices; sprinkle with salt, pepper,
and stir until well mixed with butter. Press to one side of spider and
let brown richly underneath, then sprinkle onions over potatoes; let
heat thoroughly; turn on a hot serving platter, top side down; sprinkle
with finely chopped parsley. Cooking the onion separately lessens the
danger of burning.


LYONNAISE POTATOES (No. 2)

  1 pint boiled potatoes, cold,
  ½ teaspoonful salt,
  Speck of pepper,
  1 teaspoonful chopped onion,
  2 tablespoonfuls beef dripping or butter,
  2 tablespoonfuls chopped parsley.

Cut the potatoes into slices, season with the salt and pepper. Fry the
onions in the dripping till light brown, put in the potato and cook
till it has taken up the fat. Add the chopped parsley and serve.


ARTICHOKE SAUTE

Cut six fine, green artichokes into quarters and remove the chokes.
Trim the leaves neatly and parboil them five minutes in salted water,
drain. Lay them in a casserole, season with salt, pepper and one-fourth
cupful butter; one-fourth cupful mushrooms, chopped fine, may be added.
Cover and cook in a moderate oven twenty-five minutes. Serve with any
desired sauce. Hollandaise is best.


BAKED BEANS

  1 quart navy beans,
  ½ pound fat salt pork, or
  1½ pounds brisket of beef,
  ½ tablespoonful mustard,
  1 tablespoonful salt,
  2 tablespoonfuls molasses,
  3 tablespoonfuls sugar,
  1 cup boiling water.

Wash, pick beans over, cover with cold water and let soak over night.
In the morning cover with fresh water, heat slowly and let cook just
below the boiling point until the skins burst, which is best determined
by taking a few on the tip of the spoon and blowing over them; if done,
the skins will burst. When done, drain beans and put in pot with the
brisket of beef. If pork is used scald it, cut through the rind in
half-inch strips, bury in beans, leaving rind exposed. Mix mustard,
salt, sugar, molasses and water, and pour over beans and add enough
more water to cover them. Cover pot and bake slowly six or eight hours.
Uncover pot the last hour so that pork will brown and crisp.


BRUSSELS SPROUTS

For Six Persons. Time of Preparation, Two Hours

  3 pounds Brussels sprouts,
  3 ounces butter,
  1 tablespoonful Gold Medal Flour,
  1 pint stock,
  A pinch of nutmeg,
  A pinch of carbonate of soda,
  A pinch of pepper,
  Salt,
  1 teaspoonful chopped parsley,
  ½ teaspoonful chopped onion.

Throw the sprouts, after removing the outer leaves, into three quarts
boiling water, with salt and a pinch of carbonate of soda. After
bringing up to the boil again, take the sprouts out and drain on a
sieve and then on a dry cloth, so that no water remains in them.

Brown an ounce of the butter with the flour and sugar, add the stock,
chopped onion and parsley, pepper, nutmeg and the remaining butter.
Boil up well, then put in the sprouts and allow all to simmer gently
for half an hour.

GREEN PEPPER MANGOES

Secure nice large peppers; cut a slit in them and take out the seed.
Slice a head of cabbage very fine, salt it as for slaw, and mix very
thick with black mustard seed; fill the peppers with this dressing and
sew up the slit. Lay them in a jar and pour over enough cold vinegar to
cover them.


GREEN TOMATO PICKLE

Slice one peck of green tomatoes; add one cup of salt, and let them
stand over night; drain the water from them and add one gallon of
vinegar, one large spoon of allspice, one teaspoonful of cloves, one
tablespoonful of cinnamon, a half teaspoonful of ground mustard, four
cups of sugar, one cup of grated horseradish, and simmer together ten
minutes; add more sugar.


SWEET TOMATO PICKLES

Eight pounds of ripe tomatoes, four pounds of sugar, a half ounce of
cloves, a half ounce of allspice and a half ounce of cinnamon. Peel the

one ounce each of cinnamon, cloves and allspice. Scald the vinegar,
put sugar and spices in, and pour over the melon. Do this for three
mornings.


BRINE FOR CUCUMBERS

Wash them in clear water, lay them in a jar, and sprinkle them well
with salt; as you lay in fresh cucumbers, add more salt. They will make
their own brine.

Cut the tomatoes in two and boil for half an hour, then press through
a hair sieve and add spices in the proportion given below, after
which boil for about three hours over a slow fire. Remove from fire,
turn it out, and let stand till next day, when you must add half a
pint of vinegar for each peck of tomatoes. For every like amount of
the vegetable, add, while boiling, one-eighth of an ounce of red and
one-quarter of an ounce of black pepper. Half an ounce each of mace,
allspice and cloves, and two ounces of mustard. Salt to suit, put in a
little ginger, and essence of celery, if you so desire. Bottle, seal
and cork and put in a dark, cool place.


MIXED PICKLES

Slice in an earthen jar one peck of green tomatoes, six large onions,
and pour over them one cupful of salt. Let stand twenty-four hours and
drain. Add one quart of cider vinegar, three pounds of brown sugar,
one-eighth of a pound of white mustard seed, one teaspoonful of ground
cloves, one teaspoonful of ginger, two teaspoonfuls of mustard, one
teaspoonful of cayenne pepper and cook slowly for fifteen minutes.

PICKLED CHERRIES

Stone five pounds of cherries. Take one quart of vinegar, two pounds of
sugar, one-half ounce each of cinnamon and mace. Grind the spices and
tie them in a muslin bag; boil the spices, sugar and vinegar together
and pour hot over the cherries.


ECONOMY VINEGAR

Save the sound cores and the parings of apples used in cooking. Put
into a jar, cover with cold water, stand in a warm place, add one-half
pint of molasses to every two gallons. Cover the jar with gauze; add
more parings and cores occasionally. This will make a good vinegar.


PICKLED BEETS

Take the beets when cold, slice them across. Make a liquid of half
vinegar and water, a little salt and pepper, a tablespoonful of sugar
and put the beets in this. This is only for present use, as if they
stand too long they turn white. You can make a bag of spices and boil
with them, also a few whole cloves.

Jams and Jellies


APPLE JELLY

Select sound, red, fine-flavored apples not too ripe; wash, wipe and
core; place in a granite kettle, cover with water and let cook slowly
until the apples look red. Pour into a muslin bag and drain; return
juice to a clean kettle and boil one-half hour; skim. Now measure and
to every pint of juice, allow a pound of sugar; boil quickly for ten
minutes. Red apples will give jelly the color of wine while that from
light fruit will be like amber.


SPICED FRUITS

These are also called sweet pickle fruits. For four pounds prepared
fruit allow one pint vinegar, two pounds brown sugar, one-half cup
whole spices—cloves, allspice, stick cinnamon, and cassia-bude. Tie
spices in thin muslin bag, boil ten minutes with vinegar and sugar.
Skim, add fruit, cook till tender. Boil down syrup, pour over fruit
in jars, and seal. If put in stone pots, boil syrup three successive
mornings and pour over fruit. Currants, peaches, grapes, pears and
berries may be prepared in this way, also ripe cucumbers, muskmelons,
and watermelon rind.


PLUM JELLY

Take plums not too ripe, put in a granite pan and set in a pan of water
over the fire. Let the water boil gently till all the juice has come
from the fruit, strain through a flannel bag and boil with an equal
weight of sugar twenty minutes.


CRAB-APPLE JELLY

Select juicy apples. Mealy ones are no good. Wash and quarter and put
into a preserving kettle over the fire with a teacupful of water. If
necessary add more water as it evaporates. When boiled to a pulp strain
the apples through a flannel bag, then proceed as for other jelly.


PRESERVED PEACHES

Select the yellow red-cheeked ones if possible (skin same as tomatoes,
by pouring on boiling water, then thrusting them in cold water and
separate in halves). Proceed as for preserving cherries, only using
three-quarters of a pound of sugar to every pound of fruit.


PRESERVED CHERRIES

Select the large cherries, remove the stems and stone them carefully.
To each pound of sugar allow one pound of cherries. Put fruit in
granite pan and pour over them the sugar. Stir up and let stand over
night to candy. In the morning put all into the preserving pan, place
on the stove and boil gently until the cherries look clear, skimming
off the scum as it rises. When the cherries have become quite clear,
remove the pan from the stove and seal. Keep in dry, dark closet.


PRESERVED TOMATOES

A pound of sugar to a pound of tomatoes. Take six pounds of each; the
peel and juice of four lemons and a quarter of a pound of ginger tied
up in a bag; put on the side of the range and boil slowly for three
hours.

STRAWBERRY JAM

To six pounds of strawberries allow three pounds of sugar. Procure
some fine scarlet strawberries, strip off the stalks and put them into
a preserving pan over a moderate fire, boil them for half an hour,
keeping them constantly stirred. Break the sugar into small pieces and
mix them with the strawberries after they have been removed from the
fire. Then place it again over the fire and boil for another half hour
very quickly. Put it into pots, and when cold cover it over with brandy
papers and a piece of paper moistened with the white of an egg over the
tops.


LEMON MARMALADE

Peel as many lemons as you wish and take out every seed. Boil the peel
until very soft, add juice and pulp with a pound of sugar to a pound of
lemons. Boil until thick and bottle.


GRAPE MARMALADE

Take sound grapes, heat and remove the seeds, then measure, and allow
measure for measure of fruit and sugar. Place all together in a
preserving kettle and boil slowly twenty-five minutes; add the juice of
one lemon to every quart of fruit. Set away in jelly glasses.


TO PRESERVE PLUMS

To every pound of fruit allow three-quarters of a pound of sugar.
Divide the plums, take out the stones, and put the fruit on a dish with
pounded sugar strewed over; the next day put them into a preserving pan
and let them simmer gently by the side of the fire for about thirty
minutes, then boil them quickly; removing the scum as it rises, and
keep them constantly stirred, or the jam will stick to the bottom of
the pan. Crack the stones and add the kernels to the preserve when it
boils.


QUINCE PRESERVES

Pare and core the fruit and boil till very tender. Make a syrup of a
pound of sugar for each pound of the fruit and after removing the scum
boil the quinces in this syrup for one-half hour.


PRESERVED LEMON PEEL

Make a thick syrup of white sugar, chop the lemon peel fine and boil it
in the syrup ten minutes; put in glass tumblers and paste paper over. A
teaspoonful of this makes a loaf of cake, or a dish of sauce nice.


BLACKBERRY JAM

Crush a quart of fully ripe blackberries with a pound of the best loaf
sugar pounded very fine; put it into a preserving pan, and set it over
a gentle fire until thick, add a glass of brandy, and stir it again
over the fire for about a quarter of an hour; then put it into pots and
when cold tie them over.

  =MAXWELL $685, F. O. B. Reno=

  =MAXWELL ROADSTER $670 F. O. B. Reno=

Compare a MAXWELL with any other car costing less than $900. There
isn’t one that can afford you the great, big real value that is in the
MAXWELL. Just for example, consider the equipment.

The MAXWELL has electric lights and starter, demountable rims,
rain-vision windshield, speedometer, mohair top, irreversible steering
gear, linoleum covered running-boards and many other refinements such
as are found on cars costing $1,100 and more.

And these MAXWELL features are included at the price of $685. Did you
ever hear of any other car at anywhere near this price that affords
such big values? You may take our word for it, there is none.

When you consider further, that the MAXWELL is a good looking car; that
it is easy riding; that it carries five passengers in comfort; that
it is the World’s Endurance Champion; that it is light in weight and
inexpensive to operate—than you will agree with us when we say that the
MAXWELL is absolutely the biggest value in the automobile field today.

Just phone or drop into our new Sales Room and let us show you the
cars. We shall gladly give you a ride.

HOW TO MEASURE AN OUNCE

Housekeepers are often confused by the mingling of weights and measures
in a recipe, therefore an accurate schedule is a good thing to have
around. The following of the most generally used articles will be found
correct:

One ounce granulated sugar equals two level tablespoonfuls.

One ounce flour, four level tablespoonfuls.

One ounce butter, two level teaspoonfuls.

One ounce ground coffee, five level tablespoonfuls.

One ounce cornstarch, three level tablespoonfuls.

ROLLED OATS—A Perfect Infant’s Food

Put two teacups Rolled Oats into three pints of boiling water into
which has been put one-half teaspoonful salt. Boil this about two hours
or until the quantity is reduced to one quart. Press the liquid portion
through a sieve with a tablespoon until the meal remaining in the sieve
is dry. Put away in bottle, and at feeding time use one-half Rolled
Oats and one-half milk. This quantity should last twenty-four hours.

Household Hints


Mildew in white clothes may be removed by soaking for a short time in a
pail of water to which has been added a heaping teaspoonful of chloride
of lime. Then hang in sun. Repeat if necessary.

When frying potatoes, etc., try chopping with empty baking powder can
instead of knife. You will find it much more handy and quicker.

Try greasing cake and bread pans with a small five-cent paint brush.
Keep grease in round tin can; cut hole in cover and insert handle of
paint brush when not in use. It is then always ready for use and does
not soil the hands.

To prevent cake from burning when using new tins, butter the new tins
well and place them in a moderate oven for fifteen minutes. After this
the cake may be cooked in them without danger of burning.

When ironing with gas, place a lid of the coal stove over the gas
burners and place the irons over this. The irons will always be clean
and heat much better than if they are put directly over the gas flame.

To clean plaster of paris figures, use toilet soapsuds and a shaving
brush. Rinse well. Dipping them in a strong solution of alum water will
give them the appearance of alabaster.

To preserve gilt frames, cover them when new with a coat of white
varnish. All specks can be washed off with water without injury.

To keep lemons, put them in water. Change once a week. Will keep a long
time.


DO YOU KNOW—

That a small piece of butter added to the water prevents vegetables,
macaroni or rice from boiling over?

That the water from macaroni or rice after they have been cooked should
be saved for soup and gravies?

That a teaspoonful of vinegar added to boiled meat, while cooking,
makes the meat tender?

That after peeling onions if celery salt is rubbed over the hands
before washing the odor will disappear?

That if you add a pinch of salt to ground coffee before boiling it will
improve the flavor?

That if kid gloves are rubbed gently with bread crumbs after each time
they are worn they will remain clean much longer than otherwise?

That a poultice made of tobacco and warm water, put between two
cloths and placed over the breast and pit of the stomach will relieve
convulsions when nothing else will? It will do no harm.

That any one who has aching feet, if the feet are placed in kerosene
for about ten minutes each day will receive the greatest relief. If
used regularly for a month is said to cure all corns and callous places
on the feet. Will not blister or do any injury.

To relieve burns get a small bottle of picric acid and with a feather
paint the burned or scalded parts, allowing it to dry. In a few minutes
all the pain will be gone and you will never feel it again. Where the
burns are very severe more than one application is sometimes necessary.
This is an invaluable remedy, especially where there are children in
the home, for they are getting burned continually.

There is nothing better than sulphur tea for the hair. It cures
dandruff, promotes the growth, makes the hair soft and glossy and is
very good to keep the hair from turning gray.

The whitish stain left on a mahogany table by a jug of boiling water or
a very hot dish may be removed by rubbing in oil and afterward pouring
a little spirits of wine on the spot and rubbing it dry with a cloth.

Wash your weathered oak woodwork and furniture with milk.

To rid your home of ants mix thoroughly two parts borax with one part
powdered sugar and put around where the ants come. For two or three
days the ants will come in swarms, but after that they will disappear.
Leave the powder around for a week or two and you will never be
bothered again with ants.

If food becomes slightly burned in cooking, set the saucepan in cold
water and it will take away burned taste.
