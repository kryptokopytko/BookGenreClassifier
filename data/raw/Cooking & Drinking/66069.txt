                           Your Canned Foods


The Home Economics Section of the American Can Company has prepared this
new recipe book to help you use canned foods in a greater variety of
ways.

These recipes have been created in the Canco Testing Kitchen to give you
new food dishes that are colorful, easy to prepare and high in nutritive
value. Simple enough for successful preparation by beginners, they offer
a challenge to the more experienced cook.

The convenient index, “What’s in Your Pantry,” is a successful key to
your menu planning with commercially canned foods.

Extensive research of the American Can Company helps the canners and
packers to develop the finest canned foods; the Canco Testing Kitchen
helps homemakers use these canned foods to the best possible advantage.

                   Menu Planning For Good Nutrition.


Knowledge of the facts for good nutrition without the application will
reap no reward. To produce and maintain good health, daily menus should
include:


EGGS

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

_One each day per person—or at least 3 to 4 a week._

Eggs may be served plain as poached, scrambled, hard-cooked, or in an
omelet; in cooking as soufflés, custards, sauces, breads or cakes and
salads.


LEAN MEAT, POULTRY OR FISH

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

_One or more servings daily. (Fresh, Canned or Frozen)_

Different kinds of meat, poultry and fish are necessary for variety of
food value and flavor. The many canned meats, poultry and fish available
make nutritious meals quick and easy to prepare. Include occasionally on
your menus, liver, kidney, salmon, sardines, tuna, herring or mackerel.


FRUITS

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

_One citrus fruit or juice—or tomato juice. One other fruit. (Canned,
Fresh or Frozen)_

Canned juices and fruits also offer an economical variety to the menu
and can be included easily and quickly to “pep up” appetites.


VEGETABLES

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

_Three or more each day. (Canned, Fresh or Frozen.) One green, leafy or
yellow vegetable. One other vegetable. One potato._

Canned vegetables offer the necessary variety to your menus. There is no
waste to canned vegetables; the entire contents of the can should be
used. It is wise to include one raw vegetable each day, especially salad
greens.


CEREALS, BREADS, AND FLOUR

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

_A cereal every day._

_At least 2 servings of whole grain or enriched white bread._

Whole grain, restored or enriched cereals are important in everyday
meals; use ready-to-eat or cooked, for breakfast with milk and fruit, in
cookies, puddings or in meat and fish loaves. Serve creamed dishes on
toast; make bread stuffings and puddings. Use enriched white flour in
home-made-breads, gravies and sauces.


SWEETS

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

_Use molasses, syrups, honey, jellies, jams, desserts and candies in
moderation to make the diet palatable but not enough to spoil the
appetite for other foods._


MILK

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

_One quart for each child. One pint for each adult. (Fresh or
Evaporated)_

Count one pint of undiluted evaporated milk (a little more than one tall
can) or ¼ pound of dry milk—or ⅓ pound of cheese as having about the
same food value as one quart of fluid milk. For variety, include milk in
your cooked foods, such as soups, creamed or scalloped dishes, ice
creams, custards or other milk desserts. For variety, include cheese,
buttermilk, malted and chocolate milks in your menus.


FATS

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

_Two or more tablespoons butter or vitamin-fortified margarine. Count
salt pork or bacon as a fat._

  However, meals need not be humdrum. Make them interesting, colorful,
  attractive. Vary the preparation of the foods you use; vary the manner
  in which you serve them. Include appealing, nutritious recipes. Your
  family will eat, and at the same time enjoy, the foods which are good
  for them.




                    Choice Luncheon or Supper Menus


For dinner menus, add an appropriate fruit or vegetable juice, fish
cocktail, hors d’oeuvre or one of the many delicious canned soups.
Include milk or milk drinks as well as coffee or tea for the beverage.

                    Using Commercially Canned Foods


Canned Foods are delicious just as they come from the can. Remember that
canned foods are cooked foods. When heating commercially canned
vegetables follow these directions:

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

1. _Drain the liquid into a saucepan._

2. _Boil it quickly to reduce the amount._

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

3. _Add the vegetable and heat quickly._

4. _Season to the family’s taste and serve._


Instead of reducing the liquid in the can, it may be saved for soups,
sauces, gravies or vegetable cocktails. Do _not_ throw it away as it
contains valuable nutrients.

Many women like to use canned foods as an ingredient of interesting
recipes. The canner has done the first hard work of preparation, so it
is easy to add variety to the menu with very little effort.




           FACTS TO REMEMBER ABOUT COMMERCIALLY CANNED FOODS


    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

1. Fruits and vegetables used for canning are especially grown for that
purpose; picked at just the right point of maturity, sealed in cans and
cooked in the briefest possible time after harvesting.

2. Nothing is added to canned fruits except a sugar syrup; and nothing
to canned vegetables except water and sometimes a little salt or sugar
for seasoning.

3. The canning process does not affect the food value of the starches,
sugars, fats and proteins. The canning industry has developed many
methods designed to conserve the vitamins and minerals of the fresh raw
products. Hence, modern commercially canned foods retain in good degree
the food values of the fresh foods used for canning.

4. Canned Food may be safely left in the open can if it is covered and
kept in a refrigerator. This you should do with left-over cooked food
stored in any type of container.

5. The use of commercially canned foods saves many hours of preparation
of raw fruits, vegetables, fish and meats, and also assures no waste.

                             The Can Opener


The can opener should be regarded as permanent equipment—not as a
kitchen gadget. The average home probably uses a can opener more
frequently than any other piece of small equipment in the kitchen.

There are dozens of makes of can openers on the market, ranging in price
from ten cents to several dollars. Some are made to be attached to the
wall—others are “hand” openers. Whatever type opener you prefer, you
should insist on good performance.


Requirements for a Good Can Opener

1. _Open the can easily._

2. _Open either a round or oblong can._

3. _Leave a smooth not a jagged edge. (The better openers roll back the
edge for perfect smoothness.)_

4. _Can be easily washed and dried._

5. _The cutting blades so placed that they may be sharpened. (Steel
knives in the kitchen need sharpening, but you don’t expect a cheap
knife to stand as many sharpenings as one of fine steel. The blades of a
can opener are steel knives designed to do a special job of cutting
through the metal of a can.)_


In addition to a regular can opener it is convenient to have an opener
especially designed for opening cans of liquid, such as fruit and
vegetable juices.
