                    HOW TO FREEZE ICE CREAM AT HOME


                                Freezing

1—Scald the freezer can to be sure it is clean and sweet.

2—Prepare the mixture to be frozen, as described in the recipes in this
book. Place the mixture in the freezer can.

3—Assemble the freezer ready for freezing.


                                Packing

4—Chip the ice in small pieces and mix with coarse ice cream salt in the
proportion of 3 to 6 parts of ice to one of salt. The 3 to 1 mixture may
be used if quicker freezing is desired, but a larger swell is obtained
by using the 6 to 1 mixture.

5—Pack ice and salt around the freezer can up to the top, turn the crank
a few times to set the ice and salt, then add more ice and salt until
the top of the can is covered.

6—Start turning the crank, slowly at first; as the mixture begins to
stiffen, turn rapidly to secure the desired beating. The special design
of the dasher makes it possible to blend and whip the cream to a
delightful mellowness.

7—If the directions have been followed, from three to five minutes
should be sufficient to freeze the cream enough to serve at once. When
frozen, be sure that the waste hole is not plugged up; pour off some of
the brine until the level of brine is well below the cover of the can.
Remove the top of the freezer and take off the can cover. Insert a cork
in the can cover to stop up the hole in the top. Remove the dasher and
scrape the ice cream into the can. Place cover on the can and add more
ice and salt to the level of the cover. It is a good idea to cover the
freezer with a thick pad of newspapers or a heavy cloth to keep the air
from the ice.

8—Allow the ice cream to “set” in this freezing mixture until time for
serving.


                           Molding the Cream

9—When time comes for serving, if desired, the cream may be turned out
in a solid form by removing the can and wrapping it in a cloth wrung out
of hot water. By hitting the can, the ice cream will slip out on to a
platter or serving dish. Be sure that the cream is tampt down thoroughly
before it is allowed to “set” if you wish the cream to be served in
cylinder form.

10—Many hostesses like to serve their ice cream in a mold. In this case,
when the mixture is frozen, place it in the mold and pack it down well
so that it will come out in a perfect shape. If two or three varieties
of cream are used, smooth off each layer before adding the next one,
smooth cream on top and cover with a piece of greased and waxed paper
(greased side up) cut larger than the mold.

Place mold in the top of packed ice and salt so that there is a layer of
salt and ice under the mold, with the top completely buried. Let it
freeze for from two to three hours.

To remove, wipe the mold with a cloth. Remove the cover and allow the
mold to stand for several minutes in a warm place.




                    WAYS OF SERVING FROZEN DESSERTS


Candied rose leaves, violets, and other flowers may be found in shops
making a specialty of them and are decorative to any cream or ice when
placed over the top or as a border around the edge of dish. Slices of
angel cake or sponge cake may be placed in ice cream dishes, a little
fruit syrup poured over each slice, then a half of a peach or slice of
pineapple. Fill up the dish with vanilla ice cream with a tablespoonful
of whipped cream on top; decorate with candied fruit.

Place ice cream on small glass plates, pour over one tablespoon of
crushed sweetened strawberries or other fruits. Top with sweetened
whipped cream, or with any desired prepared sauce. See recipes for
sauces.

To make Croquettes: Take ice cream from freezer with a scoop, roll in
blanched almonds which have been chopped fine and browned in the oven.
Serve in glass plates surrounded with following sauce: Beat up whites of
three eggs until stiff, add 1 cup double cream and beat until stiff
again, add one-half cup of sugar, one teaspoon orange extract, and
one-half cup chopped preserved cherries.

To make Sandwiches: Cut cake into slices, cut slices of ice cream and
put between slices of cake. Decorate with powdered macaroons.

Scoop out the pulp of well-flavored cantaloupes and half fill tall
lemonade glasses with melon seasoned with a little lemon juice and
powdered sugar and dash of cinnamon. Fill up glasses with vanilla ice
cream. Decorate with candied lemon or orange peel. To serve Bisque:
Arrange lady fingers or oblong sweet wafers in box shape on ice cream
plate and tie in place with narrow ribbon. Fill with bisque. Decorate
with candied flowers.

Remove peeling from bananas and split lengthwise. Sprinkle with powdered
sugar and lemon juice. Arrange on oblong ice cream dishes; place ice
cream on bananas, pour over crushed berries, top with sweetened whipped
cream. Decorate with maraschino cherries.

thread. Pour gradually over egg yolks that have been beaten until light
lemon colored, beating constantly. Blend ½ cup sugar and flour, add
milk, and cook until thickened, stirring thoroughly and frequently. Add
egg yolk mixture and cook several minutes longer. Cool. Stir in
flavorings and fold in whipped cream. Freeze.

                            Coffee Ice Cream
                                                        (Makes 2 quarts)

cream whipped stiff. Freeze.


                          Sour Cream Ice Cream

The cream may be thick sour and used with perfect safety, so that the
most fastidious person could not detect it. It is not only a matter of
economy but makes a much richer cream than the same amount when sweet.

For chocolate, make a custard of one quart of milk, two eggs, one cup of
sugar, and one tablespoon of flour. Melt two squares of chocolate and
add to the custard. When cold, flavor with one teaspoon of vanilla. Just
before freezing, add one pint of sweet milk, one cup of sugar, and one
pint of sour cream and beat until thoroughly mixed. Freeze as usual.

Sour cream may be used with other custards in a similar manner, adding
after the custard is cool, beating thoroughly. It is especially
delicious with fruits.

Peel the oranges, shred the peel, and add 1 cup hot water. Boil for 5
minutes, then drain and discard the water. Add another cup hot water and
ginger. Boil again for 5 minutes, drain, and discard the peel. Make a
syrup of this water, the sugar, and the grated lemon rind. When the
sugar is dissolved, add the orange pulp which has been cut into small
pieces and all the fibre and membranes removed. Simmer for 2 or 3
minutes. Remove from the stove, cool, and add the remaining 3 cups cold
water and freeze to a mush. Beat the egg whites until stiff, fold in the
whipped cream, and stir into the half-frozen fruit mixture. Continue
freezing until firm. Allow the ice cream to ripen in the freezer for 3
or 4 hours. Serve in sherbet glasses with lemon-flavored golden sponge
cake.
