                      EASY, ECONOMICAL, DELICIOUS_




 How spaghetti can help you serve more delicious, more nourishing meals
                             FOR LESS MONEY


    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

It takes real planning to feed a family both economically and well. But
you’ll find Franco-American Spaghetti a big help in solving your
problem. Few foods provide so much real nourishment and deliciousness—at
such low cost. Serve it by itself as a main dish or in combination with
other foods.

Franco-American Spaghetti furnishes plenty of protein for building
muscles. It is especially rich in carbohydrates needed for energy. It
combines with other foods to make a variety of satisfying, delicious
meals. Add a salad or simple fruit dessert and you have a well-balanced
menu—easy to digest, easy on the budget.

Spaghetti combines wonderfully with other foods. Combine it with
left-over meat into appetizing casseroles. Use it to dress up cheaper
cuts of meat. Serve it on a platter with lamb stew or meat balls. Your
family will look forward to Friday dinners if you make a tasty casserole
of spaghetti and salmon or other inexpensive fish. They’ll enjoy green
peppers stuffed with savory spaghetti, too.

Attractive menu suggestions are given with each recipe in this leaflet.
They give you meals which are inexpensive and easy to prepare. Look them
over now and surprise your family with one tonight.




                             WHY YOU SHOULD
                              _Insist on_
                            Franco-American


    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

It makes a big difference _which_ spaghetti you serve. Franco-American
is different as can be from the ordinary ready-cooked kind.

Its tangy, tempting sauce is rich with the luscious goodness of fine
ripe tomatoes and golden Cheddar cheese. It’s seasoned to savory
perfection with costly spices—a skillful blend of eleven different
ingredients. “Far better than I could ever make,” good home cooks tell
us.

Yet you can enjoy this “millionaire’s dish” for less than three cents a
portion! A can of Franco-American is usually no more than ten cents. You
can’t buy uncooked spaghetti, with all your other ingredients, and
prepare it yourself for so little.

Serve these savory spaghetti dishes twice a week or oftener. Keep a
supply of Franco-American on hand. Order several cans from your grocer
today. It’s a great time and money-saver in your kitchen.
