PREFACE.


The first edition of the COLORADO LEGISLATIVE MANUAL is herewith
presented. While designed for the use of the General Assembly, it cannot
fail to interest all classes--the lawyer, the merchant, the aspirant
after political honors, and even the young who are ripening into manhood
and soon to share its grave responsibilities. It contains information
which cannot be elsewhere acquired without a great expenditure of time
and patience, in the examination of records, the reconciliation of
numerous discrepancies, the supplement of omissions and the correction
of errors. The pre-State history is necessarily brief. Sketches of
prominent characters, and comments on events and the acts of individuals
are not introduced, for the reason that the period of the narrative
should be removed some distance from the present age to secure the
historian from undue prejudice and partiality. The settlement of
Colorado, now a flourishing State, began scarcely twenty years ago. A
sense of propriety, therefore, demands that only a plain, accurate and
truthful statement be made of what occurred in connection with that
settlement. In the preparation of the Legislative Annals, much labor and
care have been expended. The Annals are as complete and correct as it
was possible to make them, considering the removals of members from the
Territory, the inaccuracy of the records and the imperfection of the
journals. To the novice in legislation, the Manual of Customs,
Precedents and Forms will prove of great value. I have sought, and
indeed have spared no pains nor expense, to make this an improvement
upon all other Legislative Manuals yet published.

This Manual will be published _biennially_ with such changes as
circumstances may require, and such improvements as experience may
suggest. That I am anxious to receive the commendation of an
appreciative public, I do not deny, and hope that their fullest sympathy
with my effort in this direction will be freely accorded. It is a
satisfaction to know, and should beget a praiseworthy pride, that
Colorado is not behind any of the oldest, most populous and wealthy
States in the character, style and completeness of this publication.

It gives me great pleasure to confess, that from the inception to the
completion of this work, I have received much kind and cordial
assistance. My warmest thanks and acknowledgments are extended to Robert
Berry and William W. Webster, experienced legislators, for their good
offices and valuable help. The courtesies of Judge Amos Steck, whose
memory of facts, dates and persons deserves special mention, and the
kindness of O. J. Goldrick, editor and proprietor of the _Rocky Mountain
Herald_, are here gratefully acknowledged.

Trusting that this work will meet the expectations of the General
Assembly, and State at large, I respectfully submit it to their
judgment.

HISTORY OF COLORADO.




CHAPTER I.


On April 3d of the year 1803, Napoleon Bonaparte, First Consul of
France, for the sum of $16,000,000, ceded to the United States, then
under the presidency of Thomas Jefferson, all that vast territory
entitled the Province of Louisiana. The province extended from the
possessions of New Spain on the south, to the boundary line of the
British possessions on the north, and had the magnificent Mississippi
river on the one side, and the great Pacific Ocean on the other. At the
close of the Mexican war, in 1848, by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo,
for the sum of $15,000,000, all New Mexico and Upper California--a
region extending from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, and containing
about 500,000 square miles--was ceded to the United States. This immense
domain, thus acquired by purchase from France and Mexico, has been
occupied by an intelligent and enterprising population, and divided into
states and territories, each an empire in its dimensions, and has been
cultivated, developed, and embellished by all the arts and inventions of
the most progressed civilization. One portion of this domain is
Colorado, destined by her position, resources and climate to enjoy an
immortal precedence among the States of our great Republic.

Before the year 1858 very little was known of Colorado. It is recorded,
with some apparent truth, that a large force of Spaniards and Indian
allies, led by Coronado, a Spanish military captain, having for their
object the discovery of gold, had, about the middle of the sixteenth
century, penetrated to this section of the Rocky Mountains. The
expedition, after incredible hardships, returned without the golden
treasures, for which they had ventured so far and suffered so much.

Soon after the transfer of the Louisiana province, and the establishment
of the United States authority therein, it was determined at Washington
to ascertain the nature of the country, the sources of its large rivers
and the general character of the climate. Accordingly, in the summer of
1806, a small expedition was equipped, and dispatched under the command
of Lieutenant Zebulon M. Pike, who, for his skillful services, was, on
his return, promoted to the rank of major. On the 15th of November,
Major Pike and his small company beheld the prominent and stately
mountain which, in honor of the commander, was named Pike’s Peak. Major
Pike, in his diary, thus refers to this peak: “This mountain was so
remarkable as to be known to all the savage nations for hundreds of
miles around, and to be spoken of with admiration by the Spaniards of
New Mexico, and was the bounds of their travels north-west.” Directing
his march with the course of the mountains, Major Pike continued his
explorations. Failing to discover the object of his search--the source
of the Red River--he retraced his steps, and proceeded in a
south-westerly direction. Determined to find the head-waters of that
important stream, and unconquered by the fearful severities of winter in
the midst of the mountains, the little party of explorers pursued their
way. Their discoveries were, however, brought to a close by an untoward
event--the capture of the whole party by the Spaniards, who held a
military post in the San Juan country. This arrest would hardly have
occurred had the boundaries between New Spain and Louisiana been
definitely known.

In the year 1819 another and larger expedition was prepared, and ordered
to explore this section of the Rocky Mountains. The party engaged in
this enterprise had advanced a considerable distance into the Indian
country without molestation, when its further progress was checked by
the loss of their horses, which had been stolen by the Pawnee Indians.
This mischance detained the expedition for a whole year. In June, 1820,
Col. S. H. Long, the commander, all losses having been repaired, resumed
his march. Early in the summer they reached the South Platte, and
followed its course until the mountains came in sight. The massive giant
peak, which stood out boldly and grandly before them, was, in honor of
Col. Long, called Long’s Peak. Col. Long made a careful examination of
the mountains from Long’s Peak to Pike’s Peak, and of the plains lying
along their base.

A very full exploration of the Rocky Mountains was made, in 1832, by
Captain Bonneville, who commanded a party fitted out by the American Fur
Company.

The most effective expedition hitherto equipped by the Government, for
purposes of exploration, was commanded by Col. Fremont, and set out in
1842. Upon his arrival at the South Platte, he sent the larger portion
of his force to Fort Laramie, a post of the American Fur Company. With
the rest of his command he advanced to Fort St. Vrain, an Indian trading
post, situated seventeen miles east from Long’s Peak, and one hundred
miles north from Pike’s Peak. From this point he journeyed northward,
exploring the country beyond the limits of Colorado.

Another band of explorers, conducted by Col. Fremont, camped at Fort St.
Vrain in July, 1843. This party made accurate surveys of the regions
known as north and south of the Divide--an elevated ridge, separating
the Arkansas and Platte valleys; crossed and re-crossed the range,
ascertained many valuable facts, and mapped out the main geographical
features of Colorado. But, so far, none of these explorers, nor any of
the white inhabitants, mostly occupied in trading, trapping and hunting,
had made any discovery of the vast mineral wealth now known to exist in
this portion of the Sierra Madre mountains.

As the limits of Kansas formerly embraced a large part of what now
constitutes Colorado, a brief summary of the early history of Kansas is
essential. The territory of Kansas was organized on the thirtieth day of
May, 1854. Then began her pupilage under the guardianship of Congress.
In theory, the relation of a territory to the national government is
that of a child to its parent. It is supposed to be under discipline and
training, by which it will, in due time, be fitted to discharge the high
and important duties incident to statehood. Kansas, it seems, was an
unruly ward, and caused much trouble and anxiety to her guardian. In the
Organic Act of the territory it was prescribed that the Constitution and
all the laws of the United States should be in full force and effect,
except the Missouri Compromise Act of 1820, which was declared to be
inoperative and void in that territory. The Missouri Compromise, thus
partially rescinded, opened the way for a pro-slavery and an
anti-slavery agitation. Anti-slavery colonies from New England, and
pro-slavery colonies from the Southern States, came to settle in the new
territory of Kansas. Confusion, riot, and bloodshed soon followed. This
unhappy state of affairs continued until the adoption of a State
constitution prohibiting slavery. This important event occurred December
6th, 1859. From that time peace and order reigned. On January 29th,
1861, an Act for the admission of Kansas into the Union as a state,
passed both Houses of Congress. On February 26th, 1861, Congress divided
the new state, and organized the western portion into a territory
bearing the name of Colorado.

We have seen that Kansas became a territory in 1854. From that year
until 1858 no one authorized to represent the territory of Kansas
appeared within the present limits of Colorado. The inhabitants before
this time, beside the employees of the American Fur Company and a few
independent trappers, hunters, and Indian traders, consisted of a
scattered population of Pueblos and Mexicans, mostly engaged in stock
raising in the vicinity of the Raton Mountains, and the roving tribes of
savages. The Indian traders, among whom were Lieutenant Lupton and Vigil
St. Vrain in the north, and Colonels Boone and Bent in the south, had
erected small forts to shield them from the savages. The junction of the
Fontaine qui Bouille with the Arkansas was a favorite winter rendezvous
for the trappers and hunters, among whom was the famous Kit Carson. In
1854, the Ute Indians massacred, in one night, all who had assembled at
this resort. Hitherto the protection of Kansas power and law had never
been invoked, nor had the needs of the scanty and motley population
occupied the attention of the Kansas government. In 1852 a party of
Cherokee Indians, on their way from Georgia to California, discovered
gold on the banks of a small stream tributary to the South Platte. On
their return journey they showed the gold and reported the place of
discovery. Exciting rumors of gold found in large quantities in the
Rocky Mountains, inflamed thousands with the desire to reach and possess
the open treasures. The first train of prospectors, led by W. Green
Russell, Esq., started from Georgia. As they passed through Missouri and
Kansas, the gold fever influenced many to leave home and competency for
the distant plains and mountains teeming with riches. The Georgians took
up their position where Denver now stands, and thoroughly prospected
Cherry Creek from its mouth to its source, but as their labors were
poorly rewarded, they gave the Platte, of which Cherry Creek is a
tributary, a fair trial for six or seven miles south. Much disappointed,
they set out for the North Platte and Green River regions, but faring
worse, returned to their first location, and were made happy by larger
returns for their labor. The first Kansas party built their camp fires
near the present site of Pueblo. As the news of gold discoveries sped
across the continent, a strong tide of emigration set in to the Pike’s
Peak country. Strings of wagons and troops of men, in constant
succession, kept crossing the great plains, anxious as they toiled on,
to catch a glimpse of the blue outlines of the mountains, where fortune
stood waiting to enrich the hardy adventurers. From all parts, and
embracing all characters, poured in the earnest crowd, all animated by a
common hope of attaining sudden wealth.

J. W. Denver, after whom Denver, the present capital of Colorado, was
called, was then governor of Kansas territory. But neither he, nor his
successor Medary, nor even Robinson, elected State governor December
6th, 1859, could give scarcely any attention to occurrences in the
distant Pike’s Peak gold regions. Their thoughts and time were almost
entirely engrossed by political events at home.

On the banks of the Platte, near the present Younker ranch, some of the
Kansas company, who had camped on the Arkansas, with others, began to
erect a number of log cabins. These were soon completed, and the name of
Montana City was applied to the settlement. In these cabins a large
party of prospectors spent the winter. On the 24th of September, a party
of nine selected the east side of Cherry Creek, near its mouth, for a
town site, and agreed to lay out 640 acres for that purpose. The
peculiar and pious name of St. Charles was given to it, but no steps
were taken to survey and plot the town or put up buildings, unless a few
logs crossed together, with an old wagon cover for a roof, might be
designated a house. Another company chose the west side of Cherry Creek
for a town site, and in the latter part of October proceeded to
construct some log cabins. These, and a number of others used as stores,
were built, and the town called Auraria, from a small mining town in
Georgia. The prospects of this new enterprise soon became encouraging,
while Montana City in time lost its inhabitants, and its tenements went
to ruin. A town company, composed mainly of Kansas citizens, on November
17th, 1858, took possession of the deserted St. Charles town site. Steps
for the erection of cabins were immediately taken in order to secure the
right of pre-emption. By New Year’s Day Denver had twenty and Auraria
forty cabins. Up to this time the settlements contained only three white
women. In the fall of 1859, a warm rivalry existed between Auraria and
Denver. This was manifested in every issue, and continued until the
consolidation of Denver and Auraria in 1860. The first inhabitants of
Boulder came to that section October 17, 1858. In the summer of 1859
settlements were made in South Park. In the autumn months of 1859
Mountain City, Boulder, Russellville, Colorado City, Golden and Arapahoe
became large settlements.

As the population increased, protection of life and property was felt as
the special need. Animated, therefore, by a common desire to establish
security, prevent and punish crime, the new settlers called a public
meeting. The meeting was held November 6, 1858, in the settlement of
Auraria, containing at that time about 200 inhabitants. The assembly,
though composed of immigrants from different states, acted as citizens
of Kansas territory. Out of the Pike’s Peak country, as that part of the
Rocky Mountains, and the plains around their base, were called, they
formed a county, defined its limits, and named it Arapahoe, from a
neighboring tribe of Indians. They also declared Auraria to be the
county seat. They then proceeded to elect a delegate to Congress and a
representative to the Kansas Legislature. H. J. Graham was chosen
delegate, and A. J. Smith representative. This action of the assembly
manifested a rare spirit of enterprise in politics. They declare a
district of Kansas to be a county, and depute one of their number to the
legislature with credentials of his election, and petitions that the
county be established, and their representative be received. At the same
time a delegate is dispatched to Congress with instructions to have the
county converted into a territory. The delegate of _Kansas_ Territory
would be duly recognized and admitted to a seat in Congress. But to the
delegate of Arapahoe county no such recognition or position would be
tendered. His labors would be confined to the advocacy of the petitions
and claims of the people he represented before committees, or with
individual members of the House or Senate. Nevertheless, Mr. Graham
hurried to Washington, impelled by the delusive hope that his mission
would be successful, and that he would enjoy the honors and emoluments
of territorial delegate. The people of Arapahoe county were 700 miles
distant from Leavenworth, the capital of Kansas, without railroads or
telegraphs, and with immense uninhabited plains lying between them and
the territorial authorities. They, therefore, naturally desired to have
the territory of Kansas divided, and the western part organized into a
new territory. This arrangement, if consummated, would place the country
on a stable footing. Peace and order would be maintained, the general
prosperity promoted, while Congress and the nation would be directly
acquainted with the growth, prospects and necessities of the country.
Mr. Graham exerted himself to prevail on Congress to respect the
petition of his constituents, but his efforts proved unsuccessful. Their
representative, A. J. Smith, succeeded in his mission, had Arapahoe
county confirmed, but was not admitted as a member of the Kansas
legislature.

During the winter of 1858 the population was only slightly increased.
The settlements were governed by local laws, devised and adopted by the
people, and these laws were executed by a Probate judge and other
officers, of the people’s appointment. The first election of Arapahoe
county officers, under Kansas laws, was held March 28, 1859. Over 700
votes were polled, of which 231 were credited to Auraria and 144 to
Denver. The spring months brought a great increase to the mining
population. From authentic sources it has been computed that, during the
summer, the Pike’s Peak gold regions contained 20,000 souls. An
established and accessible government became indispensable. The subject
pressed itself more and more urgently on the public mind. Their first
attempt, in 1858, to impress Congress favorably with the necessities of
their situation, had proved abortive. But a profound sense of their
needs moved them to renew their efforts to prevail on Congress to
consummate a partition of the territory of Kansas, and to establish a
separate government in this distant but populous region. A mass meeting
was called, to convene in Auraria, April 11th, 1859. In the resolutions
adopted, it was expressed as the unanimous sentiment of the meeting,
that a separate and distinct government was not only important but
necessary. By these resolutions, also, the several precincts of Arapahoe
county were requested to choose delegates, to meet in joint convention
on the fourth day after the meeting, April 15th, to consider the
question of organizing a new state or territory. On the day appointed
the delegates met. In order to save time and determine quickly, they
pursued an eminently judicious course. They resolved on one subject of
debate, and only one: “The formation of a new and independent state of
the Union.” It must be remembered that Kansas, at this time, was only a
territory, though pressing her claims for recognition and admission as a
State. Thus early, and prematurely, as facts subsequently proved, did
the people, who crowded into this new country, seek for the honors and
privileges of statehood. While these delegates were in session, or
shortly after, the _Rocky Mountain News_, the pioneer journal of
Colorado, issued its first edition, April 23d, 1859. This Auraria
convention, as a summing up of their labors, ordered a general election
of delegates on the second Monday in May, to meet on the first Monday in
June. At the time designated fifty delegates assembled. As in the April
convention, only one subject, it seems, engaged their deliberations--the
attainment of statehood. The work of drafting a constitution was
entrusted to eight committees, in order to economize time and secure a
complete instrument. The committees were requested to report, and submit
their labors to a fuller convention, which was enjoined to meet on the
first Monday in August. In the interval the several committees prepared
their work. When the convention, which consisted of one hundred and
sixty-seven delegates, met, the committees presented their reports. A
constitution was completed, and arrangements made for its acceptance or
rejection by the votes of the people. Though some members of the
convention were sanguine of success, the majority thought that the
result would be adverse, and sought to provide against such a
contingency. The day set for voting on the constitution and movement for
a state, was the first Monday in September. The convention therefore
resolved that should the constitution be rejected, a delegate to
Congress should be elected on the first Monday in October. The delegate
would represent Jefferson Territory--the name given by the convention to
Arapahoe county, or Pike’s Peak gold regions. On September 4th the votes
far or against the constitution were cast, and resulted in 2,007
against, and 649 for, that instrument. A short time (about ten days)
before the October election, it was proposed, at a mass meeting held in
Auraria, that on the day a delegate to Congress was elected, delegates
should be chosen to form a Provisional Territorial Government. The
proposition was adopted. Accordingly, on the first Monday in October
this double election took place.

The governor of Kansas, in 1859, had issued a proclamation that Arapahoe
county be established, and that a representative be elected. The
Arapahoe county election for Kansas officials was therefore also held.
Captain Richard Sopris was elected representative, and was the first
member from Arapahoe county admitted to a seat in the Kansas
legislature. An event, worthy of relation, is the arrival of the
Leavenworth and Pike’s Peak express, May 17th, 1859. This assured direct
communication with the capital of Kansas, and thence with all the
States. It was a day of congratulations, and one to be remembered.
Another noticeable matter of record is the visit of Horace Greeley,
editor of the _N. Y. Tribune_, who witnessed, with extraordinary
interest the operations of gold mining. A letter, to which he attached
his own signature, was published June 6th, 1859. This letter set forth
in strong language the large returns of the mines and placer diggings.
As a consequence, another immigration that fall largely increased the
population.

At the October election above mentioned, B. D. Williams was chosen
delegate to Congress. He was the exponent of the August convention, and
entrusted with the mission to memorialize Congress to separate the
Pike’s Peak region from Kansas, and organize it into a territory under
the name of Jefferson. The other delegates chosen were instructed to
form a Provisional Government. Eighty-six delegates met in convention.
They entered upon their duties with great earnestness. A new
constitution, called the “Organic Act of the Territory of Jefferson,”
was framed and adopted. Other important measures received their
approval. The territory was divided into legislative districts. A full
state ticket was nominated, and an election ordered for the fourth
Monday of October, the same month in which they had been elected, had
convened, had acted. The election took place; 2,000 votes were cast in
twenty-seven precincts. The Provisional Government was adopted, a full
corps of legislators chosen, and, indeed, all but one of the entire
ticket elected. The purpose of the parties who had determined on a
Provisional Government ran swift to its fulfillment. The legislature
thus suddenly and questionably brought into existence, met and began
their session. The message of the governor, R. W. Steele, was received
with the usual formalities, and the session was passed in diligent
legislative labors. Many general and special laws were enacted; nine
counties were organized; a poll-tax of one dollar was imposed, and a
committee appointed to report full civil and criminal codes to an
adjourned session, January 23d, 1860. In each of the nine newly
organized counties the governor appointed a Probate Judge, to hold
office until the regular county election on the first Monday in January,
1860. The legislature met pursuant to adjournment, and for the remainder
of the session devoted their attention to the report of the committee.
Full civil and criminal codes were finally adopted. An _imperium in
imperio_ was now fairly established. Right in the midst of the Kansas
Government stood the Provisional Government. The first resistance to the
authority of the latter, and protest against its legality, arose from
the Arapahoe county officials, who were elected according to Kansas
territorial law, and were, therefore, beyond a doubt, legal. Besides
this, a remonstrance against the per capita tax, signed by seven hundred
miners, was sent down from the mountains. In the valley, therefore, the
Kansas and the Provisional governments held divided sway; and in the
mountains the Miners’ Courts and the Provisional Government contended
for the mastery. Golden was the only settlement that wholly submitted to
the Provisional Government. In truth, the authority of the Kansas
officials was never fairly recognized, and they soon ceased to have even
a nominal existence.

From 1858 to some time in 1861, two kinds of courts existed in the
Pike’s Peak region, whose decisions were final. These were called the
People’s Courts and the Miners’ Courts. The People’s Courts were
improvised assemblies of the people, who convened to adjudicate criminal
cases, such as murders, homicides, and other felonies. They were usually
presided over by a probate judge or justice of the peace. The extreme
penalties were hanging, lashes on the bare back, and banishment. The
Miners’ Courts were differently organized. Pursuant to a general call,
all occupying a mining district met together. They fixed the limits of
their district, adopted a miners’ code, defined the duties of officers,
and elected them for the ensuing year. A president, judge, sheriff,
collector, surveyor, and recorder, who was _ex officio_ treasurer and
secretary of the district, composed the officers of the court, who were
all responsible to the superior tribunal, the Miners’ Meeting. These
courts settled all claims and offences in mining districts. When a case
was not settled in the courts, it was carried to the Miners’ Meeting.
There was no appeal from their decision. The courts organized under the
Provisional Government were respected by the people, and their decisions
accepted with general satisfaction. In Denver and some other places the
People’s Courts alone were recognized.

The year 1860 witnessed great activity in mining throughout the
mountains. April 3d, 1860, Denver and Auraria, by mutual agreement of
the citizens, were consolidated. During this year the celebrated
Consolidated Ditch, constructed for mining uses, was completed. In the
fall of 1860 Edward M. McCook was elected representative to the Kansas
legislature. It is certain that no bills were passed for the benefit of
his constituents, who formed a very small minority of the people, and it
is a matter of doubt whether he received more than his mileage. On New
Year’s Day, 1860, Denver had two hundred and Auraria four hundred
houses, with a combined settled population of one thousand. At the close
of 1860 it was estimated that sixty thousand people, chiefly transient,
were in the Pike’s Peak country, and the population in and around
Denver, four thousand.

The Pony Express, which started simultaneously from St. Joseph,
Missouri, and Sacramento, California, April 9th, 1860, and which was
conceived and made a success by the bold enterprise of W. H. Russell,
Esq., was an event of unusual consequence to the whole nation. Telegrams
from New York, by this conveyance, were delivered in San Francisco in
eight days and four hours, and letters from San Francisco reached St.
Joseph, Missouri, in eight days and nine hours. The great Pacific Mail
Steamship Company had, for about ten years, held the contract for the
transportation of the U. S. mails. This service realized a million
dollars annually. By this line the transit of the mails took
twenty-three days. But this achievement of the pony express, reducing
the time to eight days and nine hours, induced the government to change
the route for the Pacific mails. The contract was given to Butterfield,
who sub-contracted to W. H. Russell, through whom the Pike’s Peak gold
regions soon had ample mail facilities. On May 1st, 1860, began the
publication of the _Rocky Mountain Herald_, daily edition, whose racy
columns drew an encouraging patronage. In August, 1860, the first mail
service was extended to the mountains. During this year, considering the
number of lawless and reckless men congregated in this new country,
comparatively few crimes were committed. The criminals guilty of murder
were tried by a People’s Court, sentenced, and hanged. During the summer
months Denver was overrun by a crew of desperadoes and robbers, who, if
resisted, did not hesitate to use any violence. They assailed the office
of the Denver _News_, and forcibly, with intent to kill, abducted the
editor for his unsparing condemnation of their outrages. But the career
of one of them was ingloriously terminated, being shot down by the
citizens, and the fate of others speedily determined by the People’s
Courts. The rest hurried away to other parts, where justice did not
follow the offender so surely and so swiftly. In the mountains crimes,
at first frequent, soon almost disappeared, owing to the vigilance and
prompt action of the Miners’ Courts. At Washington the Congressional
delegate indefatigably pressed the petitions of the people, and urged
the necessity of immediately organising a territory. Thus 1860 passed.

The next year, so full of great events, brought the desired relief. On
the 26th of February, 1861, a bill passed Congress designating the
boundaries of the new territory of Colorado, which embraced portions of
Kansas, Nebraska, and Utah, and providing for its political organization
and administration. The news of this important event was received with
great demonstrations of joy.




CHAPTER II.

ORGANIC ACT.

AN ACT TO PROVIDE A TEMPORARY GOVERNMENT FOR THE TERRITORY OF COLORADO.

_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled_, That all that part of the
territory of the United States included within the following limits,
viz: commencing on the thirty-seventh parallel of north latitude, where
the twenty-fifth meridian of longitude west from Washington crosses the
same; thence north on said meridian to the forty-first parallel of north
latitude; thence along said parallel west to the thirty-second meridian
of longitude west from Washington; thence south on said meridian to the
northern line of New Mexico; thence along the thirty-seventh parallel of
north latitude to the place of beginning; be and the same is hereby
erected into a temporary government by the name of the Territory of
Colorado: _Provided_, That nothing in this act contained shall be
construed to impair the rights of person or property now pertaining to
the Indians in said Territory, so long as such rights shall remain
unextinguished by treaty between the United States and such Indians, or
to include any territory which, by treaty with any Indian tribe, is not,
without the consent of said tribe, to be included within the territorial
limits or jurisdiction of any State or Territory; but all such territory
shall be excepted out of the boundaries, and constitute no part of the
territory of Colorado, until said tribe shall signify their assent to
the President of the United States to be included within the said
Territory, or to affect the authority of the government of the United
States to make any regulations respecting such Indians, their lands,
property, or other rights, by treaty, law, or otherwise, which it would
have been competent for the government to make, if this act had never
passed: _Provided further_, That nothing in this act contained shall be
construed to inhibit the government of the United States from dividing
said Territory into two or more territories, in such manner and at such
times as Congress shall deem convenient and proper, or from attaching
any portion thereof to any other Territory or State.

SEC. 2. _And be it further enacted_, That the executive power and
authority in and over said Territory of Colorado shall be vested in a

duties and receive the emoluments of Superintendent of Indian Affairs,
and shall approve all laws passed by the Legislative Assembly before

years, unless sooner removed by the President of the United States; he
shall record and preserve all the laws and proceedings of the
Legislative Assembly hereinafter constituted, and all the acts and
proceedings of the Governor, in his executive department; he shall
transmit one copy of the laws and one copy of the executive proceedings
on or before the first day of December in each year, to the President of
the United States, and, at the same time, two copies of the laws to the
Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate
for the use of Congress. And in case of the death, removal, or
resignation, or other necessary absence of the Governor from the
Territory, the Secretary shall have, and is hereby authorized and
required to execute and perform, all the powers and duties of the
Governor during such vacancy or necessary absence, or until another
Governor shall be duly appointed to fill such vacancy.

SEC. 4. _And be it further enacted_, That the legislative power and
authority of said Territory shall be vested in the Governor and a
Legislative Assembly. The Legislative Assembly shall consist of a
Council and House of Representatives. The Council shall consist of nine
members, which may be increased to thirteen, having the qualifications
of voters as hereinafter prescribed, whose term of service shall
continue two years. The House of Representatives shall consist of
thirteen members, which may be increased to twenty-six, possessing the
same qualifications as prescribed for members of the Council, and whose
term of service shall continue one year. An apportionment shall be
made, as nearly equally as practicable, among the several counties or
districts for the election of the Council and House of Representatives,
giving to each section of the Territory representation in the ratio of
its population (Indians excepted) as nearly as may be; and the members
of the Council and House of Representatives shall reside in, and be
inhabitants of, the district for which they may be elected respectively.
Previous to the first election, the Governor shall cause a census or
enumeration of the inhabitants of the several counties and districts of
the Territory to be taken; and the first election shall be held at such
time and places, and be conducted in such a manner as the Governor may
direct; and he shall, at the same time, declare the number of the
members of the Council and House of Representatives to which each of the
counties or districts shall be entitled under this act. The number of
persons authorized to be elected, having the highest number of votes in
each of said Council districts for members of the Council shall be
declared by the Governor to be duly elected to the Council; and the
person or persons authorized to be elected having the greatest number of
votes for the House of Representatives, equal to the number to which
each county or district shall be entitled, shall be declared by the
Governor to be elected members of the House of Representatives:
_Provided_, That in case of a tie between two or more persons voted for,
the Governor shall order a new election, to supply the vacancy made by
such tie. And the persons thus elected to the Legislative Assembly shall
meet at such place and on such day as the Governor shall appoint; but
thereafter the time, place, and manner of holding and conducting all
elections by the people, and the apportioning and representation in the
several counties or districts to the Council and House of
Representatives, according to the population, shall be prescribed by
law, as well as the day of the commencement of the regular session of
the Legislative Assembly; _Provided_, That no session shall exceed the
term of forty days, except the first, which may be extended to sixty
days, but no longer.

SEC. 5. _And be it further enacted_, That every free white male citizen
of the United States, above the age of twenty-one years, who shall have
been a resident of said Territory at the time of the passage of this

forty-eight, and the treaty negotiated with the same country on the
thirtieth of December, eighteen hundred and fifty-three, shall be
entitled to vote at the first election, and shall be eligible to any
office within the said Territory; but the qualifications of voters and
of holding office at all subsequent elections shall be such as shall be
prescribed by the Legislative Assembly.

SEC. 6. _And be it further enacted_, That the legislative power of the
Territory shall extend to all rightful subjects of legislation
consistent with the Constitution of the United States and the provisions
of this act; but no laws shall be passed interfering with the primary
disposal of the soil; no tax shall be imposed upon the property of the
United States; nor shall the lands or other property of non-residents be
taxed higher than the lands or other property of residents; nor shall
any law be passed impairing the rights of private property; nor shall
any discrimination be made in taxing different kinds of property; but
all property subject to taxation shall be in proportion to the value of
the property taxed.

SEC. 7. _And be it further enacted_, That all township, district, and
county officers, not herein otherwise provided for, shall be appointed
or elected, as the case may be, in such manner as shall be provided by
the Governor and Legislative Assembly of the Territory. The Governor

Legislative Assembly, appoint all officers not herein otherwise provided
for; and in the first instance the Governor alone may appoint said
officers, who shall hold their offices until the end of the first
session of the Legislative Assembly, and shall lay off the necessary
districts for members of the Council and House of Representatives, and
all other officers.

SEC. 8. _And be it further enacted_, That no member of the Legislative
Assembly shall hold or be appointed to any office which shall have been

one year after the expiration of such term; and no person holding a
commission or appointment under the United States, except postmasters,
shall be a member of the Legislative Assembly, or shall hold any office
under the government of said Territory.

SEC. 9. _And be it further enacted_, That the judicial power of said
Territory shall be vested in a Supreme Court, District Courts, Probate

for, both appellate and original, and that of the Probate Courts and of
the Justices of the Peace, shall be as limited by law: _Provided_, That
Justices of the Peace and Probate Courts shall not have jurisdiction of
any matter in controversy where the title or boundaries of land may be
in dispute, or where the debt or sum claimed shall exceed one hundred
dollars; and the said Supreme and District Courts, respectively, shall
possess chancery as well as common law jurisdiction; and authority for
redress of all wrongs committed against the constitution or laws of the
United States or of the Territory, affecting persons or property. Each

where the court may be held. Writs of error, bills of exception, and
appeals, shall be allowed in all cases from the final decisions of said
District Courts to the Supreme Court, under such regulations as may be
prescribed by law; but in no case removed to the Supreme Court shall
trial by jury be allowed in said Court. The Supreme Court, or the
Justices thereof, shall appoint its own Clerk, and every clerk shall
hold his office at the pleasure of the court for which he shall have
been appointed. Writs of error and appeals from the final decisions of
said Supreme Court shall be allowed, and may be taken to the Supreme

regulations as from the Circuit Courts of the United States, where the
value of the property or the amount in controversy, to be ascertained by
the oath or affirmation of either party, or other competent witness,
shall exceed one thousand dollars; and each of the said District Courts
shall have and exercise the same jurisdiction, in all cases arising
under the constitution and laws of the United States, as is vested in
the Circuit and District Courts of the United States; and the said
Supreme and District Courts of the said Territory, and the respective

in which the same are grantable by the Judges of the United States in
the District of Columbia; and the first six days of every term of said
courts, or so much thereof as shall be necessary, shall be appropriated
to the trial of causes arising under the said constitution and laws, and
writs of error and appeals in all such cases shall be made to the
Supreme Court of said Territory the same as in other cases. The said
Clerk shall receive in all such cases the same fees which the Clerks of
the District Courts of Oregon received for similar services.

SEC. 10. _And be it further enacted_, That there shall be appointed an
Attorney for said Territory, who shall continue in office for four
years, unless sooner removed by the President, and who shall receive the
same fees and salary as the Attorney of the United States for the
Territory of Oregon. There shall also be a Marshal for the Territory

removed by the President, and who shall execute all processes issuing
from said courts when exercising their jurisdiction as Circuit and
District Courts of the United States; he shall perform the duties, be
subject to the same regulations and penalties, and be entitled to the
same fees as the Marshal of the District Court of the United States for
the Territory of Oregon, and shall, in addition, be paid two hundred
dollars annually as a compensation for extra services.

SEC. 11. _And be it further enacted_, That the Governor, Secretary,
Chief Justice, and Associate Justices, Attorney, and Marshal shall be
nominated, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,
appointed by the President of the United States. The Governor and
Secretary to be appointed as aforesaid shall, before they act as such,
respectively take an oath or affirmation before the District Judge, or
some Justice of the Peace in the limits of said Territory duly
authorized to administer oaths and affirmations by the laws now in force
therein, or before the Chief Justice, or some Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States, to support the constitution of the
United States, and faithfully to discharge the duties of their
respective offices, which said oaths, when so taken, shall be certified
by the person by whom the same shall have been taken; and such
certificate shall be received and recorded by the Secretary among the
executive proceedings; and the Chief Justice and Associate Justices, and
all other civil officers in said Territory, before they act as such,
shall take a like oath or affirmation, before the said Governor or
Secretary, or some Judge or Justice of the Peace of the Territory who
may be duly commissioned and qualified, which said oath or affirmation
shall be certified and transmitted by the person taking the same to the
Secretary, to be by him recorded as aforesaid; and afterwards the like
oath or affirmation shall be taken, certified and recorded in such
manner and form as may be prescribed by law. The Governor shall receive
an annual salary of fifteen hundred dollars as Governor, and one
thousand dollars as Superintendent of Indian Affairs; the Chief Justice
and Associate Justices shall receive an annual salary of eighteen
hundred dollars. The said salaries shall be paid quarter yearly at the
Treasury of the United States. The members of the Legislative Assembly
shall be entitled to receive three dollars each per day during their
attendance at the session thereof, and three dollars for every twenty
miles travel in going to and returning from the said sessions, estimated
according to the nearest usually traveled route. There shall be
appropriated annually the sum of one thousand dollars, to be expended by
the Governor, to defray the contingent expenses of the Territory. There
shall also be appropriated, annually, a sufficient sum to be expended by
the Secretary of the Territory, and upon an estimate to be made by the
Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, to defray the expenses
of the Legislative Assembly, the printing of the laws, and other
incidental expenses; and the Secretary of the Territory shall annually
account to the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States for the
manner in which the aforesaid sum shall have been expended.

SEC. 12. _And be it further enacted_, That the Legislative Assembly of
the Territory of Colorado shall hold its first session at such time and
place in said Territory as the Governor thereof shall appoint and
direct; and at said first session, or as soon thereafter as they shall
deem expedient, the Governor and Legislative Assembly shall proceed to
locate and establish the seat of government for said Territory at such
place as they may deem eligible, which place, however, shall thereafter
be subject to be changed by the said Governor and Legislative Assembly.

SEC. 13. _And be it further enacted_, That a delegate to the House of
Representatives of the United States, to serve during each Congress of
the United States, may be elected by the voters qualified to elect
members of the Legislative Assembly, who shall be entitled to the same
rights and privileges as are exercised and enjoyed by the Delegates from
the several other Territories of the United States to the said House of
Representatives. The first election shall be held at such time and
places, and be conducted in such manner as the Governor shall appoint
and direct; and at all subsequent elections the times, places, and
manner of holding elections shall be prescribed by law. The person
having the greatest number of votes shall be declared by the Governor to
be duly elected, and a certificate thereof shall be given accordingly.

SEC. 14. _And be it further enacted_, That when the land in the said
Territory shall be surveyed, under the direction of the Government of
the United States, preparatory to bringing the same into market,
sections numbered sixteen and thirty-six in each town in said Territory
and be and the same are hereby reserved for the purpose of being
applied to schools in the States hereafter to be erected out of the
same.

SEC. 15. _And be it further enacted_, That temporarily, and until
otherwise provided by law, the Governor of said Territory may define the
judicial districts of said Territory, and assign the Judges who may be

the times and places for holding courts in the several counties or
subdivisions in each of said judicial districts by proclamation to be
issued by him; but the Legislative Assembly, at their first or any
subsequent session, may organize, alter or modify such judicial
districts, and assign the Judges, and alter the times and places of
holding the courts, as to them shall seem proper and convenient.

SEC. 16. _And be it further enacted_, That the Constitution and all laws
of the United States, which are not locally inapplicable, shall have the
same force and effect within the said Territory of Colorado as elsewhere
within the United States.

responsibilities, compensation, and allowances for clerk hire, office
rent, fuel, and incidental expenses, shall be the same as those of the
Surveyor General of New Mexico, under the direction of the Secretary of
the Interior, and such instructions as he may from time to time deem it

Approved February 28th, 1861.


AMENDMENTS TO THE ORGANIC ACT.

AN ACT TO AMEND AN ACT ENTITLED “AN ACT TO PROVIDE A TEMPORARY
GOVERNMENT FOR THE TERRITORY OF COLORADO.”

_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled_, That the second section of the
act to which this act is an amendment, be altered so as to read as
follows: The executive power and authority in and over said Territory of
Colorado, shall be vested in a Governor, who shall hold his office for
four years, and until his successor shall be appointed and qualified,
unless sooner removed by the President of the United States. The
Governor shall reside within said Territory, shall be
commander-in-chief of the militia thereof, shall perform the duties, and
shall receive the emoluments of Superintendent of Indian Affairs; he may
grant pardons for offences against the laws of said Territory, and
reprieves for offenses against the laws of the United States, until the
decision of the President shall be made known thereon; he shall
commission all officers who shall be appointed to office under the laws
of said Territory, and shall take care that the laws be faithfully
executed.

SEC. 2. _And be it further enacted_, That every bill which shall have
passed the Legislative Assembly shall, before it become a law, be
presented to the Governor of the Territory; if he approve, he shall sign
it; but if not he shall return it, with his objections, to the house in
which it originated, who shall enter the objections at large on their
journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If, after such reconsideration,
two-thirds of that house shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent,
together with the objections, to the other house, by which it shall
likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two-thirds of that house,
it shall become a law. But in all such cases the votes of both houses
shall be determined by yeas and nays, to be entered on the journal of
each house respectively. If any bill shall not be returned by the
Governor within three days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been
presented to him, the same shall be a law in like manner as if he had
signed it, unless the Assembly, by adjournment, prevents its return, in
which case it shall not be law.

SEC. 3. _And be it further enacted_, That section nine of the act to
which this act is amendatory be altered so as to read as follows:
Section 9. _And be it further enacted_, That the judicial power of said
Territory shall be vested in a Supreme Court, District Courts, Probate
Courts, and Justices of the Peace. The Supreme Court shall consist of a
Chief Justice and two Associate Justices, any two of whom shall
constitute a quorum, and who shall hold a term at the seat of government
of said Territory, annually, and they shall hold their offices during
the period of four years. The said Territory shall be divided into three
judicial districts, and a District Court shall be held in each of said
districts by one of the Justices of the Supreme Court, at such time and
place as may be prescribed by law; and the said judges shall, after
their appointments, respectively reside in the districts which shall be
assigned them. The jurisdiction of the several courts herein provided
for, both appellate and original, and of Justices of the Peace, shall be
as limited by law; _Provided_, That Justices of the Peace shall not have
jurisdiction of any matter in controversy, when the title or boundaries
of land may be in dispute, or when the debt or sum claimed shall exceed
three hundred dollars; and the said Probate Court shall not have
jurisdiction in any matter in controversy, when the debt or sum claimed
shall exceed the sum of two thousand dollars; and said Supreme and
District Courts shall have authority for redress of all wrongs committed
against the constitution and laws of the United States; and the said
Supreme, District, and Probate Courts respectively, shall possess
chancery, as well as common law jurisdiction, and authority for the
redress of all wrongs committed against the laws of said Territory,
affecting persons or property. Each District Court, or the judge
thereof, shall appoint its clerk, who shall also be the Register in
Chancery, and shall keep his office at the place where the court may be
held. Writs of error, bills of exception and appeals shall be allowed
from the final decisions of said District and Probate Courts to the

CHAPTER III.


In 1861 the Kansas officials had disappeared. The Provisional government
continued to exercise its partially acknowledged authority until the
arrival of the United States appointees for the new Territory. These
arrived on the 29th of May. The Federal officers, who then came, with
their sealed commissions, were: William Gilpin, Governor; Lewis Ledyard
Weld, Secretary; B. F. Hall, Chief Justice; S. N. Pettis, and Charles
Lee Armor, Associate Justices; Copeland Townsend, Marshal; James E.
Dalliba, Attorney General; F. M. Case, Surveyor General. The Provisional
government now ceased. Its laws had been published, but not enforced,
and its officers had the honor, but not the pay, of the positions they
held.

Governor Gilpin was welcomed with undisguised pleasure. His greeting was
a perfect ovation. The people now felt a new sense of security, for the
strong arm of the General Government was in their midst. The Governor at
once proceeded with commendable energy to discharge the functions of his
high office. His first duty was to see the settlements of the Territory,
and ascertain the character, condition and wants of the people. This
visitation was accomplished with great celerity. Wherever the Governor
went, the joy and hospitality of the people knew no bounds. Everywhere
he was welcomed with bouquets, balls, congratulations. On his return to
Denver, in accordance with his prescribed duty, a census was ordered.
The returns exhibited a population of 25,329. The proportion of men to
women was nearly five to one. The Governor, qualified July 8th, and was
now in the full exercise of his authority. The other co-ordinate branch
of Federal Government had now to be established. This was the United
States Supreme Court. On July 10th, the Governor assigned the judges to
their districts, and the Supreme Court immediately organized. On July
11th, he issued a proclamation, in which the Territory was declared to
be one Congressional District, and the Congressional District to be
divided into nine Council, and thirteen Representative Districts, and in
which the election of a delegate to Congress, and of Legislative
Assembly were ordered. The election was duly held on the 19th of
August--Hiram P. Bennet was elected delegate to Congress. The
Legislature of the Territory of Colorado convened on the 9th of
September. They adopted full civil, and criminal codes. They recognized
the miners as authority in mining legislation, acknowledged the legality
of their courts, adopted their laws, confirmed their decisions, and
arranged for the transfer of cases to the regular courts, so that no
jarring, nor inconvenience was experienced. Great praise is due to this
legislative body for the laws they enacted, and though some have been
found faulty, and others repealed, yet they have effectually served the
needs of the Territory. When the rebellion had been in progress for
several months, Gov. Gilpin issued a call for volunteers. Recruits
quickly responded to the call, and the first regiment of Colorado
infantry, under Col. John P. Slough, soon took the field. This infantry
was transformed into a cavalry regiment, and did good service in
repelling the Texan invasion early in 1862. During this year immigration
received a strong impetus. It was computed that the daily arrivals,
averaging one hundred, added in a short time ten thousand to the
population as returned by the census. The city of Denver, including
Auraria and Highland, was again incorporated in November, 1861. Among
the industries, placer mining was most successfully prosecuted,
California gulch alone yielding one million dollars.

In April, 1862, Dr. John Evans superseded Governor William Gilpin. The
levy of the second regiment of Colorado cavalry was made this year, and
the troops ordered to Missouri. In 1863 they were consolidated with the
third regiment raised in Colorado. This body of cavalry did effective
service in Missouri, and in 1864 won considerable renown in the
movements executed against Price in his last invasion. They took a
prominent part in four battles, to wit: Mine Creek, Oct. 22; Westport,
Oct. 23; Charlot, Oct. 25; Newtonia, Nov. 4. The quantity of gold
obtained by gulch mining this year exceeded any previous yield. H. P.
Bennet was re-elected delegate to Congress in September.

In the year 1863 began in the East the stupendous speculation in gold
mines. The spirit of speculation had infected all classes of people, and
financial schemes were quickly devised to draw millions from the public.
Among these Colorado mines prominently figured. On the 19th of April
Denver lost, by a severe conflagration, a sum estimated at a quarter of
a million dollars. A branch telegraph line was completed from Julesburg
to Denver in October, whereby telegraphic communication with the world
was established. On the 7th of October a treaty was concluded with the
Tabeguache band of Utah Indians, by which the Indian title to all of the
settled portions of the mountains of Colorado, and most of the San Luis
valley, was extinguished.

The year 1864 was the gloomy period of the rebellion. Speculation
became a mania. Stock companies of the most gigantic character were
organized on the basis of Colorado gold mines. It need hardly be said
that thousands lost large sums by reckless investments in gold mining
stocks. In the spring the Indians of the plains, composed of Sioux,
Cheyennes, and Arapahoes, combined to carry on a bloody and
exterminating war against the whites. They attacked the coaches;
murdered, scalped, and mutilated the passengers. Exposed dwellings were
surrounded and the inmates massacred. Emboldened by little or no
resistance, they admitted no pause to their savage butcheries. This
thoroughly roused the people to punish the hostile fiends. Twelve
hundred men, under the command of Col. J. M. Chivington, hurried forward
to meet the merciless savages, and arrest their work of horrors. They
found and suddenly assailed a large troop of Cheyennes, about seven
hundred in number, and with hearts steeled against mercy, dealt swift
retribution, sparing neither age nor sex, until nearly all were
destroyed. This stunning blow checked the Indian outrages. A temporary
quiet ensued, and the roads were again animated with coaches and wagon
trains. Much credit is due to Captain Tyler, who, with his brave
company, opened and protected the line of communication with the States.
On May 19th, a more disastrous calamity befell Denver than the fire of
the preceding year. An appalling flood swept down Cherry Creek,
overwhelming large buildings, and sweeping them and their contents down
its destructive current. Twenty persons perished in the ruthless waters.
The damages were computed to be a million dollars. Near the close of the
Thirty-eighth Congress, a bill was passed, in response to a petition of
the Colorado Legislature, enabling the territory to organize a State
government and enter the Union. Under its provisions a convention met in
Denver July 4th, 1864, and framed a constitution. This was rejected by
the people on the second Tuesday of October. In the fall of 1864, A. A.
Bradford was elected delegate to Congress.

In 1865 the Indians renewed hostilities, apparently determined to force
back immigration. All intercourse with the East was interrupted for a
time. Business was paralyzed. Lonely ranches were invaded, and their
occupants fiendishly massacred. This second outbreak of the Indians was
effectually checked by United States troops. In the spring of this year
all parties concurred in another attempt to organize a state. A
convention met in Denver in August, and framed a constitution, which was
adopted by a majority of 155. A State legislature, and the complement of
State officers, were elected November 14th. Ex-Governor William Gilpin
was chosen State Governor. Ex-Governor John Evans and Jerome B. Chaffee
were chosen senators by the legislature. Application for the admission
of Colorado as a state was made during each session of the Thirty-ninth
Congress. A strong disinclination to grant the application was
manifested. An exigency, however, arose, which changed their
disposition. The President, Andrew Johnson, had been impeached. The
success of the impeachment was involved in doubt. To secure two senators
and a representative, an enabling act was passed to admit the new state.
The President, as might be expected, vetoed the bill. Governor John
Evans was superseded by Alexander Cummings, who qualified October 19th.

In 1866 a reaction followed the prostration of trade and industry
consequent upon the Indian outrages of the preceding year. An unwonted
stimulus pervaded the territory. Mining pursuits were followed with
fresh vigor. In Denver and other places building was carried on with
unparalleled activity. Money became plentiful, and many laid the
foundations of large fortunes. George M. Chilcott was elected delegate.
Up to this time the bullion deposited in the mint amounted to 12,401,372
dollars, said to be less than half of the real yield.

On May 27th, 1867, A. C. Hunt superseded Governor Cummings. The struggle
for statehood ended with the winter of 1867-8, when it was found
impossible to pass the bill over the veto. In the fall the Denver Board
of Trade was organized, which principally labored to initiate the
enterprise of building a railroad to join the Union Pacific road at
Cheyenne. Near the close of the year the Union Pacific road reached
Cheyenne. The Denver Pacific Railway and Telegraph Company was
incorporated November 18th, 1867. During this year the various interests
of Colorado were ably represented at the Universal Exposition in Paris.
The first gold medal was awarded to the minerals of Colorado. The French
Government, moved by Colorado’s display at the Exposition, appointed an
Imperial Commissioner, who visited the territory and reported his
observations therein for the benefit of capital and science in France.
The Kiowas and Comanches, the Cheyennes and Arapahoes were removed to
reservations bordering on Colorado and Kansas, where their southern
boundary lines meet. By their treaties they stipulate to withdraw
opposition to immigrants, settlers, and lines of railroad.

In 1868 A. A. Bradford was again elected delegate to Congress.

On June 15th, 1869, Edward M. McCook superseded Governor A. C. Hunt.

The Denver Pacific Railway Company had been formed in 1867. Its
principal object, as stated in the articles of incorporation, was to
build a railroad and telegraph line to Cheyenne, and there connect with
the Union Pacific road. After some delay the funds were secured, the
construction of the road hastened, and on the 23d day of June, 1870, the
first train arrived in Denver. On the 15th day of August, the Kansas
Pacific Railway, 640 miles in length, was completed. In September,
seventeen miles of the Colorado Central were finished. The connection of
Golden with Denver was thereby effected. During this year successful
efforts were made to plant colonies in choice sections of the Territory.
The Meeker-Greeley colony was organized in New York in the winter of
1869-70, and located in the spring. It now has a population of 2,000,
happy and prosperous, and distinguished by prohibition laws and devotion
to temperance. The town site of the colony is a delta formed by the
Cache-a-la-Poudre and South Platte rivers. The Chicago-Colorado colony
is largely composed of Western men, and is animated by a liberal
progressive spirit. The location of the colony is in every way most
desirable. The energy and enterprise of the colonists excite great
admiration. They have already a beautiful town, and a large extent of
country under cultivation. The German colony may also be mentioned. It
occupied Wet Mountain Valley, which lies in Pueblo and Fremont counties.
Thus, by rapid transit, the Territory was brought into close
communication with the States, and began to fill up with thousands, who,
independently, or in co-operative association, settled for the purposes
of agriculture. No sign so cheering as a settlement of a country by
intelligent, enterprising farmers. Hardy, industrious miners had already
crowded into the mountains, and skillful, energetic farmers now
collected on the plains, intent to reap from them rich and abundant
harvests. In the fall, Jerome B. Chaffee was elected delegate to
Congress.

This year, 1871, dates the settlement of the Colorado Springs colony,
distinguished for its rapid and prosperous growth. Situated seventy-five
miles south from Denver, it became the temporary terminus of the Denver
and Rio Grande railway, which was completed to that point during this
year. The railroad has since passed on to Pueblo, and thence to La Veta,
with branches to El Moro, and Canon City.

In 1872, Jerome B. Chaffee was re-elected delegate to Congress.

In 1873, a large immigration into the San Juan region commenced, owing
to reports of rich mineral discoveries. S. H. Elbert superseded Gov. E.
M. McCook. Following the custom of those removed from office, the
ex-Governor proceeded to Washington to confer with the federal
authorities, and in January, 1874, was re-appointed in place of Gov.
Elbert. Severe and bitter editorials filled the columns of the press
devoted to the fallen regime. A temporary division of the Republican
party ensued. A lively contest for political supremacy followed and
continued until the usual period for an election to Congress, when the
two sides of the party marshaled themselves, the one to rebuke and the
other to sustain the administration. The malcontents not only turned the
election against the Republican nominee, H. P. H. Bromwell, but gave a
large and unprecedented majority to the Democratic nominee, Thomas M.
Patterson. This change in the popular vote deeply touched the
administration, and it was determined, in order to reconcile the
disaffected, to remove the obnoxious appointments, and fill the federal
offices with men not implicated in the controversy.

During the year 1874, the South Park railroad was finished to Morrison.

John L. Routt, the successor to Gov. McCook, qualified on March 29th,
1875. He set to work without delay to unite the discordant factions and
succeeded. The people in general were now fully persuaded that the time
had come for demanding the privileges of Statehood. The Republican
delegate, Jerome B. Chaffee, had during the winter of 1874-5, drawn up
an Enabling Act with much skill, and by persistent effort and untiring
zeal, had, in the face of strong opposition, effected the passage of the
bill. Before its passage the Act was amended so as to postpone the date
of admission to July 4th, 1876.

    Colorado to form a constitution and State government, and for

BILL OF RIGHTS.

In order to assert our rights, acknowledge our duties, and proclaim the
principles upon which our government is founded, we declare:

SECTION 1. That all political power is vested in and derived from the
people; that all government, of right, originates from the people, is
founded upon their will only, and is instituted solely for the good of
the whole.

SEC. 2. That the people of this State have the sole and exclusive right
of governing themselves, as a free, sovereign and independent State; and
to alter and abolish their constitution and form of government whenever
they may deem it necessary to their safety and happiness, provided such
change be not repugnant to the Constitution of the United States.

SEC. 3. That all persons have certain natural, essential and inalienable
rights, among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defending
their lives and liberties; that of acquiring, possessing and protecting
property; and of seeking and obtaining their safety and happiness.

SEC. 4. That the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and
worship, without discrimination, shall forever hereafter be guaranteed;
and no person shall be denied any civil or political right, privilege,
or capacity, on account of his opinions concerning religion; but the
liberty of conscience hereby secured shall not be construed to dispense
with oaths or affirmations, excuse acts of licentiousness, or justify
practices inconsistent with the good order, peace, or safety of the
State. No person shall be required to attend or support any ministry or
place of worship, religious sect, or denomination against his consent.
Nor shall any preference be given by law to any religious denomination
or mode of worship.

SEC. 5. That all elections shall be free and open; and no power, civil
or military, shall at any time interfere to prevent the free exercise of
the right of suffrage.

SEC. 6. That courts of justice shall be open to every person, and a
speedy remedy afforded for every injury to person, property, or
character; and that right and justice should be administered without
sale, denial, or delay.

SEC. 7. That the people shall be secure in their persons, papers, homes
and effects from unreasonable searches and seizures; and no warrant to
search any place or seize any person or thing shall issue without
describing the place to be searched, or the person or thing to be
seized, as near as may be, nor without probable cause, supported by oath
or affirmation, reduced to writing.

SEC. 8. That, until otherwise provided by law, no person shall, for a
felony, be proceeded against criminally, otherwise than by indictment,
except in cases arising in the land and naval forces, or in the militia
when in actual service in time of war or public danger. In all other
cases offenses shall be prosecuted criminally by indictment or
information.

SEC. 9. That treason against the State can consist only in levying war
against it, or in adhering to its enemies, giving them aid and comfort;
that no person can be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of
two witnesses to the same overt act, or on his confession in open court;
that no person can be attainted of treason or felony by the General
Assembly; that no conviction can work corruption of blood or forfeiture
of estate; that the estates of such persons as may destroy their own
lives shall descend or vest as in cases of natural death.

SEC. 10. That no law shall be passed impairing the freedom of speech;
that every person shall be free to speak, write or publish whatever he
will on any subject, being responsible for all abuse of that liberty;
and that all suits and prosecutions for libel, the truth thereof may be
given in evidence, and the jury, under the direction of the court, shall
determine the law and the fact.

irrevocable grant of special privileges, franchises, or immunities,
shall be passed by the General Assembly.

such manner as shall be prescribed by law, or in cases of tort or where
there is a strong presumption of fraud.

SEC. 13. That the right of no person to keep and bear arms in defense of
his home, person and property, or in aid of the civil power when thereto
legally summoned, shall be called in question; but nothing herein
contained shall be construed to justify the practice of carrying
concealed weapons.

by consent of the owner, except for private ways of necessity, and
except for reservoirs, drains, flumes or ditches on or across the lands
of others, for agricultural, mining, milling, domestic or sanitary
purposes.

SEC. 15. That private property shall not be taken or damaged, for public
or private use, without just compensation. Such compensation shall be
ascertained by a board of commissioners, of not less than three
freeholders, or by a jury when required by the owner of the property, in
such manner as may be prescribed by law, and until the same shall be
paid to the owner, or into court for the owner, the property shall not
be needlessly disturbed, or the proprietary rights of the owner therein
divested; and whenever an attempt is made to take private property for a

without regard to any legislative assertion that the use is public.

to appear and defend in person and by counsel; to demand the nature and
cause of the accusation; to meet the witnesses against him face to face;

a speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the county or district in
which the offense is alleged to have been committed.

SEC. 17. That no person shall be imprisoned for the purpose of securing
his testimony in any case longer than may be necessary in order to take
his deposition. If he can give security he shall be discharged; if he
cannot give security, his deposition shall be taken by some Judge of the
Supreme, District, or County Court, at the earliest time he can attend,
at some convenient place by him appointed for that purpose, of which
time and place the accused and the attorney prosecuting for the people,
shall have reasonable notice. The accused shall have the right to appear
in person and by counsel. If he have no counsel, the Judge shall assign
him one in that behalf only. On the completion of such examination the
witness shall be discharged on his own recognizance, entered in before
said Judge, but such deposition shall not be used if, in the opinion of
the Court the personal attendance of the witness might be procured by
the prosecution, or is procured by the accused. No exception shall be
taken to such deposition as to matters of form.

SEC. 18. That no person shall be compelled to testify against himself in
a criminal case, nor shall any person be twice put in jeopardy for the
same offense. If the jury disagree, or if the judgment be arrested after
verdict, or if the judgment be reversed for error in law, the accused
shall not be deemed to have been in jeopardy.

in any house without the consent of the owner, nor in time of war except
in the manner prescribed by law.

SEC. 23. The right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate in criminal
cases; but a jury in civil cases in all courts, or in criminal cases in
courts not of record, may consist of less than twelve men, as may be
prescribed by law. Hereafter a Grand Jury shall consist of twelve men,
any nine of whom concurring may find an indictment: _Provided_, the
General Assembly may change, regulate or abolish the grand jury system.

SEC. 24. That the people have the right peaceably to assemble for the
common good, and to apply to those invested with the powers of
government for redress of grievances, by petition or remonstrance.

SEC. 25. That no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property,

distinct departments--the Legislative, Executive and Judicial--and no

under this Constitution, shall begin on the day appointed for the first
meeting of the General Assembly. The officers of the Executive
Department, excepting the Lieutenant Governor, shall, during their term
of offices, reside at the seat of government, where they shall keep the

Governor, who shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.

SEC. 3. The officers named in section one of this article, shall be
chosen on the day of the general election, by the qualified electors of
the State. The returns of every election for said officers shall be
sealed up and transmitted to the Secretary of State, directed to the
Speaker of the House of Representatives who shall immediately, upon the
organization of the House, and before proceeding to other business open
and publish the same in the presence of a majority of the members of
both Houses of the General Assembly, who shall for that purpose assemble

Senate, appoint all officers whose offices are established by this

the recess of the Senate a vacancy occur in any such office, the
Governor shall appoint some fit person to discharge the duties thereof
until the next meeting of the Senate, when he shall nominate some person
to fill such office. If the office of Auditor of State, State Treasurer,
Secretary of State, Attorney General, or Superintendent of Public
Instruction, shall be vacated by death, resignation, or otherwise, it
shall be the duty of the Governor to fill the same by appointment, and
the appointee shall hold his office until his successor shall be elected

General Assembly, at its first session thereafter, a transcript of the
petition, all proceedings, and the reasons for his action.

SEC. 8. The Governor may require information in writing from the
officers of the Executive Department upon any subject relating to the
duties of their respective offices, which information shall be given
upon oath whenever so required; he may also require information in
writing at any time, under oath, from all officers and managers of State
institutions, upon any subject relating to the condition, management and
expenses of their respective offices and institutions. The Governor
shall, at the commencement of each session, and from time to time, by
message, give to the General Assembly information of the condition of
the State, and shall recommend such measures as he shall deem expedient.

of the expenditures of all moneys belonging to the State, and paid out
by him. He shall, also, at the commencement of each session, present
estimates of the amount of money required to be raised by taxation for
all purposes of the State.

SEC. 9. The Governor may, on extraordinary occasions, convene the
General Assembly, by proclamation, stating therein the purpose for which
it is assembled; but at such special session no business shall be
transacted other than that specially named in the proclamation. He may,
by proclamation, convene the Senate in extraordinary session for the
transaction of executive business.

SEC. 10. The Governor, in case of a disagreement between the two Houses
as to the time of adjournment, may, upon the same being certified to him
by the House last moving adjournment, adjourn the General Assembly to a
day not later than the first day of the next regular session.

SEC. 11. Every bill passed by the General Assembly shall, before it
becomes a law, be presented to the Governor. If he approve, he shall
sign it, and thereupon it shall become a law; but if he do not approve,
he shall return it, with his objections, to the House in which it
originated, which House shall enter the objections at large upon its
journal, and proceed to reconsider the bill. If then two-thirds of the
members elected agree to pass the same, it shall be sent, together with
the objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be
reconsidered, and if approved by two-thirds of the members elected to
that House, it shall become a law, notwithstanding the objections of the
Governor. In all such cases the vote of each House shall be determined
by ayes and noes, to be entered upon the journal. If any bill shall not
be returned by the Governor within ten days after it shall have been
presented to him, the same shall be a law in like manner as if he had
signed it, unless the General Assembly shall, by their adjournment,
prevent its return, in which case it shall be filed, with his
objections, in the office of the Secretary of State, within thirty days
after such adjournment, or else become a law.

SEC. 12. The Governor shall have power to disapprove of any item or
items of any bill making appropriations of money, embracing distinct
items, and part or parts of the bill approved shall be law, and the item
or items disapproved shall be void, unless enacted in manner following:
If the General Assembly be in session, he shall transmit to the House,
in which the bill originated, a copy of the item or items thereof
disapproved, together with his objections thereto, and the items
objected to shall be separately reconsidered, and each item shall then
take the same course as is prescribed for the passage of bills over the
Executive veto.


LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR.

SEC. 13. In case of the death, impeachment, or conviction of felony or
infamous misdemeanor, failure to qualify, resignation, absence from the
State, or other disability of the Governor, the powers, duties and
emoluments of the office, for the residue of the term, or until the
disability be removed, shall devolve upon the Lieutenant Governor.

SEC. 14. The Lieutenant Governor shall be President of the Senate, and
shall vote only when the Senate is equally divided. In case of the
absence, impeachment or disqualification from any cause of the
Lieutenant Governor, or when he shall hold the office of Governor, then
the President _pro tem._ of the Senate shall perform the duties of the
Lieutenant Governor, until the vacancy is filled or the disability
removed.

SEC. 15. In case of the failure to qualify in his office, death,
resignation, absence from the State, impeachment, conviction of felony,
or infamous misdemeanor, or disqualification from any cause, of both the
Governor and Lieutenant Governor, the duties of the Governor shall
devolve on the President of the Senate _pro tem._, until such
disqualification of either the Governor or Lieutenant Governor be
removed, or the vacancy be filled; and if the President of the Senate,
for any of the above named causes, shall become incapable of performing
the duties of Governor, the same shall devolve upon the Speaker of the
House.

SEC. 19. The officers named in section one of this article, shall
receive for their services a salary to be established by law, which

copy of this ordinance.

_Sixth_--The votes cast at said election for the adoption or rejection
of the Constitution, shall be canvassed in the manner prescribed by the
laws of the Territory of Colorado for canvassing the votes at general
elections; and the returns of said election shall be made to the acting
Governor of the Territory, who, with the Chief Justice and the United
States Attorney of said Territory, or any two of them, shall canvass the
same, and if a majority of the legal votes cast shall be for the
Constitution, the acting Governor shall certify the same to the
President of the United States, together with a copy of said
Constitution and the Ordinances adopted by this Convention.

In conformity with the requirements of an Act of the Congress of the
United States, entitled “An Act to enable the People of Colorado to form
a Constitution and State Government, and for the admission of said
State into the Union on an equal footing with the original States,”
approved March 3d, A. D. 1875, on behalf and by the authority of the
People of the Territory of Colorado, this Convention, assembled in
pursuance of said Enabling Act, at the city of Denver, the capital of
said Territory, on the 20th day of December, A. D. 1875, does ordain and
declare:

_First_--That perfect toleration of religious sentiment shall be

Congress of the United States, entitled “An Act to enable the People of
Colorado to form a Constitution and State Government, and for the
admission of the said State into the Union on an equal footing with the
original States,” approved March 3d, A. D. 1875, and assembled at the
seat of government of said Territory, in pursuance of said Act, on the
twentieth day of December, A. D. 1875, after the organization of said
Convention, and before proceeding to other business, it was, on the 22d
day of December, A. D. 1875.

_Resolved_--That in pursuance of the Enabling Act, and in behalf of the
People of Colorado, we in convention assembled, do adopt the
Constitution of the United States.

       *       *       *       *       *

The constitution was submitted to the people and adopted July 1st, 1876,
by a large majority. The votes returned stood 15,443 for, and 4,039
against the constitution. This constitution is an admirable production,
and reflects great credit on those who framed it. Though not perfect, it
contains the excellencies of all the State constitutions so far
promulgated, and largely conforms in spirit to the liberality and
intelligence of the people for whom it was prepared. President Grant,
empowered by Congress, on July 4th, 1876, just one century since the
declaration of independence, admitted the new State into the Union by
proclamation. Hence Colorado’s title--“The Centennial State.” (The honor
of first applying this title to Colorado is due to Capt. R. W. Woodbury,
editor and proprietor of the _Denver Times_.)


THE PROCLAMATION OF THE PRESIDENT ADMITTING THE STATE OF COLORADO INTO
THE UNION.

WHEREAS, The Congress of the United States did, by an act approved on
the third day of March, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five,
authorize the inhabitants of the Territory of Colorado to form for
themselves, out of said Territory, a State Government, with the name of
the State of Colorado, and for the admission of such State into the
Union on an equal footing with the original states upon certain
conditions in said act specified; and,

WHEREAS, It was provided by said Act of Congress that the Convention
elected by the people of said Territory to frame a State Constitution,
should, when assembled for that purpose, and after organization, declare
on behalf of the people that they adopt the Constitution of the United
States, and should also provide by an ordinance, irrevocable without the
consent of the United States and the people of said State, that perfect
toleration of religious sentiment shall be secured, and that no
inhabitant of said State shall ever be molested in person or property on
account of his or her mode of religious worship, and that the people
inhabiting said Territory do agree and declare that they forever
disclaim all right and title to the unappropriated public lands lying
within said Territory, and that the same shall be and remain at the sole
and entire disposition of the United States, and that lands belonging to
citizens of the United States residing without the said State, shall
never be taxed higher than lands belonging to residents thereof, and
that no taxes shall be imposed by the State on lands or property therein
belonging to, or which may hereafter be purchased by, the United States;
and,

WHEREAS, It was further provided by said Act that the Constitution thus
formed for the people of the Territory of Colorado should, by an
ordinance of the Convention forming the same, be submitted to the people
of said Territory for ratification or rejection at an election to be
held in the month of July, eighteen hundred and seventy-six, at which
election the lawful voters of said new State should vote directly for or
against the proposed Constitution, and the returns of said election
should be made to the acting Governor of the Territory, who, with the
Chief Justice and United States attorney of said Territory, or any two
of them, should canvass the same, and if a majority of legal votes
should be cast for said Constitution in said proposed State, the said
acting Governor should certify the same to the President of the United
States, together with a copy of said Constitution and Ordinances;
whereupon it should be the duty of the President of the United States to
issue his proclamation declaring the State admitted into the Union on an
equal footing with the original states without any further action
whatever on the part of Congress; and

WHEREAS, It has been certified to me by the acting Governor of said
Territory of Colorado, that within the time prescribed by said Act of
Congress a Constitution for said proposed State has been adopted, and
the same ratified by a majority of the legal voters of said proposed new
State, in accordance with the conditions prescribed by said Act of
Congress; and

WHEREAS, A duly authenticated copy of said Constitution, and of the
declaration and ordinances required by said Act of Congress has been
received by me:

Now, therefore, I, Ulysses S. Grant, President of the United States of
America, do, in accordance with the provisions of the Act of Congress
aforesaid, declare and proclaim the fact that the fundamental conditions
imposed by Congress on the State of Colorado, to entitle that State to
admission to the Union have been ratified and accepted, and that the
admission of said State into the Union is now complete.

In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and have caused the
seal of the United States to be affixed.

Done at the city of Washington this first day of August, in the year of
our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-six, and of the
independence of the United States of America the one hundred and first.

  U. S. GRANT.

  By the President:
  HAMILTON FISH,
  Secretary of State.

In the spring of this year the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroad
was completed to Pueblo.

The Republican State Convention met at Pueblo August 23d, and the
Democratic State Convention at Manitou, August 29th. Full state tickets
were nominated by each convention. Both parties entered upon the
campaign not only sanguine, but confident of success. Up to the day of
election the most strenuous efforts were put forth to insure victory.
On the third day of October, as directed by the Constitution, the
election was held. The vote polled was nearly 30,000. The entire
Republican state ticket for the executive and judicial departments was
elected. John L. Routt was chosen Governor; Lafayette Head,
Lieutenant-Governor; William M. Clark, Secretary of State; D. C.
Crawford, Auditor; George C. Corning, Treasurer; A. J. Sampson, Attorney
General; Joseph C. Shattuck, Superintendent Public Instruction. The
Legislature, in both House and Senate, had a Republican majority. In the
Senate, nineteen Republicans and seven Democrats; in the House,
thirty-one Republicans and eighteen Democrats. James B. Belford was
elected Representative for the Forty-fourth and Forty-fifth Congresses.
The Territorial Secretary had ordered an election for representative for
the Forty-fourth Congress to be held October 3d, and afterwards an
election for the Forty-fifth Congress to be held November 7th. On the
third of October the people voted for a representative for both
Congresses. The State Canvassing Board received and counted the returns.
The Secretary recalled his order for an election November 7th, but an
election was held, and Thomas M. Patterson received almost the entire
vote. This vote the Canvassing Board refused to count. The next Congress
will decide the contest.

At noon on November 1st the General Assembly convened. On November 3d
the executive officers were duly inaugurated. Judge Brazee administered
the oaths of office. The Governor then delivered his inaugural message
to the General Assembly. This message of the first governor of the State
of Colorado is a sensible and well-written document. Its statements are
accurate and clear, and its suggestions thoroughly practical. He thus
addresses the General Assembly: “The people, by their choice, have
signified their faith in your wisdom, integrity, and patriotism, and I
feel assured that their confidence will not have been misplaced. Upon
you, Senators and Representatives, rests the responsibility of making
our laws, and I trust that in your legislation you will have a single
eye to the promotion of the general welfare. In this object it will be
my greatest pleasure and chief aim to co-operate.” In this message it is
stated that the present export of gold and silver bullion and ores
amounts to nearly $8,000,000 annually, with a prospect of an increase to
$10,000,000 in the near future. The total value of real and personal
property in Colorado, in 1876, is estimated to be about $100,000,000. Up
to 1877 the bullion deposited in the Denver mint amounted to almost
$70,000,000 in value. The population of Colorado in 1870 was about
40,000, in 1876, 135,000. In the early part of the session the General
Assembly chose two Senators--Jerome B. Chaffee and Henry M. Teller; and
three Presidential Electors--Herman Beckurts, W. L. Hadley, and Otto
Mears. After a protracted session, the General Assembly adjourned _sine
die_, March 20, 1877.

Colorado, on account of its altitude, is quite near that great ocean of
positive electricity which envelops the earth about a mile from its
surface. It is one of the great electrodes of the globe. All that ascend
her high peaks are charged with this subtle element. To this, in a
measure, is to be attributed that peculiar bracing and life-inspiring
atmosphere for which Colorado is renowned. This atmosphere is dry, pure
and clear, and nearly always pervaded with sunshine. The climate
therefore possesses great restorative properties, and cannot fail to be
a prominent resort for invalids. But besides this, in magnificent and
varied scenery Colorado is not excelled by any other land, and in rich
resources is unequalled. In Colorado large sums have been expended in
imposing school structures, and teachers are liberally remunerated. A
spirit of religious toleration that is truly gratifying prevails
throughout the State. All creeds are represented, and, in general, well
supported. Towns spring into existence and grow with magic speed; mines
are developed with much energy; farms show thrift and prosperity; new
railroads are projected; the lines of those already built are extending;
manufactures increase, though slow in their establishment; and,
notwithstanding an occasional exodus, the population steadily advances.




CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.


We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect
union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the
common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of
liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this
Constitution of the United States of America.


ARTICLE I.

SECTION I.

1. All legislative powers herein granted, shall be vested in a Congress
of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of
Representatives.


SECTION II.

1. The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen
every second year, by the people of the several States; and the electors
in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of
the most numerous branch of the State legislature.

2. No person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to
the age of twenty-five years, and been seven years a citizen of the
United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that
State in which he shall be chosen.

3. Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the
several States which may be included within this Union, according to
their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the
whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a
term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all
other persons. The actual enumeration shall be made within three years
after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within
every subsequent term of ten years in such manner as they shall by law
direct. The number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every
thirty thousand, but each State shall have at least one Representative;

and Providence Plantations, one; Connecticut, five; New York, six; New
Jersey, four; Pennsylvania, eight; Delaware, one; Maryland, six;

SECTION III.

1. The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators
from each State, chosen by the legislature thereof, for six years, and
each Senator shall have one vote.

2. Immediately after they shall be assembled, in consequence of the
first election, they shall be divided, as equally as may be, into three
classes. The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated
at the expiration of the second year; of the second class, at the
expiration of the fourth year; and of the third class, at the expiration
of the sixth year; so that one-third may be chosen every second year;
and if vacancies happen, by resignation or otherwise, during the recess
of the legislature of any State, the executive thereof may make
temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature, which
shall then fill such vacancies.

3. No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained the age of
thirty years, and been nine years a citizen of the United States, and
who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that State for which he
shall be chosen.

4. The Vice-President of the United States shall be President of the
Senate; but shall have no vote unless they be equally divided.

5. The Senate shall choose their other officers, and also a President
_pro tempore_, in the absence of the Vice-President, or when he shall
exercise the office of President of the United States.

6. The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. When
sitting for that purpose they shall be on oath or affirmation. When the
President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall
preside; and no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of
two-thirds of the members present.

7. Judgment, in cases of impeachment, shall not extend further than to
removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office
of honor, trust, or profit under the United States; but the party
convicted shall, nevertheless, be liable and subject to indictment,
trial, judgment, and punishment, according to law.


SECTION IV.

1. The times, places, and manner of holding elections for Senators and
Representatives shall be prescribed in each State, by the legislature
thereof, but the Congress may at any time, by law, make or alter such
regulations, except as to the places of choosing Senators.

2. The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such
meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by
law appoint a different day.


SECTION V.

1. Each House shall be the judge of the elections, returns, and
qualifications of its own members, and a majority of each shall
constitute a quorum to do business; but a smaller number may adjourn
from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the attendance of
absent members, in such manner and under such penalties as each House
may provide.

2. Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its
members for disorderly behavior, and with a concurrence of two-thirds,
expel a member.

3. Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and from time to
time publish the same, excepting such parts as may, in their judgment,
require secrecy; and the yeas and nays of the members of either House,
on any question, shall, at the desire of one-fifth of those present, be
entered on the journal.

4. Neither House, during the session of Congress, shall, without the
consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to other
place than that in which the two houses shall be sitting.


SECTION VI.

1. The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for
their services, to be ascertained by law, and paid out of the treasury
of the United States. They shall, in all cases, except treason, felony,
and breach of the peace, be privileged from arrest during their
attendance at the session of their respective Houses, and in going to
and returning from the same; and for any speech or debate in either
House, they shall not be questioned in any other place.

2. No Senator or Representative shall, during the time for which he was
elected, be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the
United States, which shall have been created, or the emoluments whereof
shall have been increased during such time; and no person holding any
office under the United States, shall be a member of either House during
his continuance in office.


SECTION VII.

1. All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of
Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments,
as on other bills.

2. Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and
the Senate, shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the
President of the United States; if he approve, he shall sign it; but if
not, he shall return it, with his objections, to that House in which it
shall have originated, who shall enter the objections, at large, on
their journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If, after such
reconsideration, two-thirds of the House shall agree to pass the bill,
it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the other House, by
which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two-thirds
of that House, it shall become a law. But in all such cases the votes of
both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays; and the names of
persons voting for and against the bill, shall be entered on the journal
of each House respectively. If any bill shall not be returned by the
President within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been
presented to him, the same shall be a law in like manner as if he had
signed it, unless the Congress, by their adjournment, prevent its
return; in which case it shall not be a law.

3. Every order, resolution, or vote, to which the concurrence of the
Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a
question of adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the
United States; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved
by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two-thirds of
the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the rules and
limitations prescribed in the case of a bill.


SECTION VIII.

The Congress shall have power,

1. To lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises; to pay the
debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the
United States; but all duties, imposts and excises shall be uniform

United States, reserving to the States respectively the appointment of
the officers and the authority of training the militia according to the
discipline prescribed by Congress:

16. To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over such
district (not exceeding ten miles square) as may by cession of
particular States, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of
government of the United States, and to exercise like authority over all
places purchased, by the consent of the legislature of the State in
which the same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals,
dock-yards and other needful buildings: and

17. To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying
into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this
constitution in the government of the United States, or in any
department or officer thereof.


SECTION IX.

1. The migration or importation of such persons as any of the States now
existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the
Congress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a
tax or duty may be imposed on such importation, not exceeding ten

2. The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended,
unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may
require it.

of the Treasury of the United States; and all such laws shall be subject
to the revision and control of the Congress. No State shall, without the
consent of Congress, lay any duty of tonnage, keep troops or ships of
war in time of peace, enter into any agreement or compact with another
State, or with a foreign power, or engage in war, unless actually
invaded, or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay.


ARTICLE II.

SECTION I.

1. The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United
States of America. He shall hold his office during the term of four
years, and together with the Vice-President, chosen for the same term,
be elected as follows:

2. Each State shall appoint, in such manner as the Legislature thereof
may direct, a number of electors equal to the whole number of Senators
and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress;
but no Senator or Representative, or person holding an office of trust
or profit under the United States, shall be appointed an elector.

3. The electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by
ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant
of the same State with themselves. And they shall make a list of all the
persons voted for, and of the number of votes for each; which list they
shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the
government of the United States, directed to the President of the
Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate
and House of Representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes
shall then be counted. The person having the greatest number of votes
shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number
of electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such
majority, and have an equal number of votes, then the House of
Representatives shall immediately choose, by ballot, one of them for
President; and if no person have a majority, then from the five highest
on the list the said House shall, in like manner, choose the President.
But in choosing the President, the votes shall be taken by States, the
representation from each State having one vote; a quorum for this
purpose shall consist of a member or members from two-thirds of the
States, and a majority of all the States shall be necessary to a choice.
In every case, after the choice of the President, the person having the
greatest number of votes of the electors, shall be the Vice-President.
But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes, the Senate
shall choose from them, by ballot, the Vice-President.

4. The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors, and the
day on which they shall give their votes, which day shall be the same
throughout the United States.

5. No person, except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United
States, at the time of the adoption of this constitution, shall be
eligible to the office of President; neither shall any person be
eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of
thirty-five years, and been fourteen years a resident within the United
States.

6. In case of the removal of the President from office, or of his death,
resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the
said office, the same shall devolve on the Vice-President, and the
Congress, may, by law, provide for the case of removal, death,
resignation, or inability, both of the President and Vice-President,
declaring what officer shall then act as President, and such officer
shall act accordingly, until the disability be removed, or a President
shall be elected.

7. The president shall, at stated times, receive for his services a
compensation, which shall neither be increased or diminished during the
period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive,
within that period, any other emolument from the United States, or any
of them.

8. Before he enters on the execution of his office, he shall take the
following oath or affirmation:

9. “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the
office of President of the United States, and will, to the best of my
ability, preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of the United
States.”


SECTION II.

1. The President shall be Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the
United States, and of the militia of the several States, when called
into the actual service of the United States. He may require the
opinion, in writing, of the principal officer in each of the executive
departments, upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective
offices; and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for
offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.

2. He shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the
Senate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators present
concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of
the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and
consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the
United States, whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for,
and which shall be established by law. But the Congress may, by law,
vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper, in
the President alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of
departments.

3. The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may
happen during the recess of the Senate, by granting commissions, which
shall expire at the end of their next session.


SECTION III.

1. He shall, from time to time, give to the Congress information of the
state of the Union, and recommend to their consideration such measures

disagreement between them, with respect to the time of adjournment, he
may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper. He shall receive
ambassadors and other public ministers. He shall take care that the laws
be faithfully executed; and shall commission all the officers of the
United States.

Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may, from
time to time, ordain and establish.

offices during good behavior; and shall, at stated times, receive for
their services a compensation, which shall not be diminished during
their continuance in office.


SECTION II.

1. The judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity,
arising under this constitution, the laws of the United States, and
treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority; to all
cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls; to all
cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to which
the United States shall be a party; to controversies between two or more
States; between a State and citizens of another State; between citizens
of different States; between citizens of the same State, claiming lands
under grants of different States, and between a State, or the citizens
thereof, and foreign States, citizens, or subjects.

2. In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and
consuls, and those in which a State shall be party, the Supreme Court
shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before
mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as
to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations, as
the Congress shall make.

3. The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by
a jury; and such trial shall be held in the State where the said crime
shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the
trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have
directed.


SECTION III.

1. Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war
against them, or in adhering to their enemies; giving them aid and
comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason, unless on the
testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in
open court.

2. The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason;
but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood or
forfeiture, except during the life of the person attainted.


ARTICLE IV.

SECTION I.

1. Full faith and credit shall be given in each State to the public
acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other State. And the
Congress may, by general laws, prescribe the manner in which such acts,
records and proceedings shall be proved, and the effect thereof.


SECTION II.

1. The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and
immunities of citizens in the several States.

2. A person charged in any State with treason, felony, or other crime,
who shall flee from justice, and be found in another State, shall, on
demand of the executive authority of the State from which he fled, be
delivered up, to be removed to the State having jurisdiction of the
crime.

3. No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws
thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or
regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall
be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may
be due.


SECTION III.

1. New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no
new State shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any
other State, nor any State be formed by the junction of two or more

the States concerned, as well as of the Congress.

2. The Congress shall have power to dispose of, and make all needful
rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property

be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States, or of
any particular State.


SECTION IV.

1. The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a
republican form of government, and shall protect each of them against
invasion; and on application of the legislature or of the executive
(when the legislature cannot be convened), against domestic violence.


ARTICLE V.

1. The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem it
necessary, shall propose amendments to this constitution; or, on the
application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the several States,
shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which, in either case,
shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this
constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the
several States, or by conventions in three-fourths thereof, as the one
or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress:
_Provided_, That no amendment, which may be made prior to the year one
thousand eight hundred and eight, shall in any manner affect the first
and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first article; and that
no State, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage
in the Senate.


ARTICLE VI.

1. All debts contracted, and engagements entered into, before the
adoption of this constitution, shall be as valid against the United
States, under this constitution, as under the confederation.

2. This constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be
made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be
made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law
of the land; and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby;
anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary
notwithstanding.

3. The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the members of
the several legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both
of the United States and of the several States shall be bound, by oath
or affirmation, to support this constitution; but no religious test
shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust
under the United States.


ARTICLE VII.

1. The ratification of the conventions of nine States shall be
sufficient for the establishment of this constitution between the States
so ratifying the same.

    _Done in Convention_, by the unanimous consent of the States
    present, the seventeenth day of September, in the year of our
    Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven, and of the

services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be
questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or
pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion
against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of
any slave, but all such debts, obligations, and claims shall be held
illegal and void.

MANUAL OF PARLIAMENTARY PRACTICE.

    NOTE.--The rules and practices peculiar to the Senate are
    printed between brackets [ ]. Those of PARLIAMENT are not so
    distinguished.


IMPORTANCE OF RULES.

SECTION I.

IMPORTANCE OF ADHERING TO RULES.

Mr. Onslow, the ablest among the Speakers of the House of Commons, used
to say, “It was a maxim he had often heard when he was a young man, from
old and experienced Members, that nothing tended more to throw power
into the hands of the administration, and those who acted with the
majority of the House of Commons, than a neglect of, or departure from,
the rules of proceeding: that these forms, as instituted by our
ancestors, operated as a check and control on the actions of the
majority, and that they were, in many instances, a shelter and
protection to the minority, against the attempts of power.” So far the
maxim is certainly true, and it is founded in good sense, that as it is
always in the power of the majority, by their numbers, to stop any
improper measures proposed on the part of their opponents, the only
weapons by which the minority can defend themselves against similar
attempts from those in power, are the forms and rules of proceeding
which have been adopted as they were found necessary, from time to time,
and are become the law of the House; by a strict adherence to which, the
weaker party can only be protected from those irregularities and abuses
which these forms were intended to check, and which the wantonness of
power is but too often apt to suggest to large and successful
majorities. 2 _Hats._, 171, 172.

And whether these forms be in all cases the most rational or not, is
really not of so great importance. It is much more material that there
should be a rule to go by, than what that rule is; that there may be a
uniformity of proceeding in business, not subject to the caprice of the
Speaker, or captiousness of the members. It is very material that order,
decency, and regularity, be preserved in a dignified public body. _2
Hats._, 149.


SECTION II.

LEGISLATIVE.

[All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of
the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of
Representatives. _Constitution of the United States, Art. 1, Sec. 1._]

[The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their
services, to be ascertained by law, and paid out of the Treasury of the
United States. _Constitution of the United States, Art. 1, Sec. 6._]

[For the powers of Congress, see the following Articles and Sections of
the Constitution of the United States: I., 4, 7, 8, 9; II., 1, 2; III.,
3; IV., 1, 3, 5, and all the amendments.]


SECTION III.

PRIVILEGE.

The privileges of Members of Parliament, from small and obscure
beginnings, have been advancing for centuries with a firm and never
yielding pace. Claims seem to have been brought forward from time to
time, and repeated, till some example of their admission enabled them to
build law on that example. We can only, therefore, state the points of
progression at which they now are. It is now acknowledged: 1st. That
they are at all times exempted from question elsewhere for anything said
in their own House; that during the time of privilege, 2d. Neither a
Member himself, his[1] wife, nor his servants, (familaries sui,) for any
matter of their own, may be[2] arrested on mesne process, in any civil
suit: 3d. Nor be detained under execution, though levied before time of
privilege: 4th. Nor impleaded, cited, or subpœnaed in any court: 5th.
Nor summoned as a witness or juror: 6th. Nor may their lands or goods be
distrained: 7th. Nor their persons assaulted, or characters traduced.
And the period of time covered by privilege, before and after the
session, with the practice of short prorogations under the connivance of
the Crown, amounts in fact to a perpetual protection against the course
of justice. In one instance, indeed, it has been relaxed by the 10 G. 3,
c. 50, which permits judiciary proceedings to go on against them. That
these privileges must be continually progressive, seems to result from
their rejecting all definition of them; the doctrine being that “their
dignity and independence are preserved by keeping their privileges
indefinite; and that ‘the maxims upon which they proceed, together with
the method of proceeding, rest entirely in their own breast, and are not
defined and ascertained by any particular stated laws.’” 1 _Blackst._,
163, 164.

[It was probably from this view of the encroaching character of
privilege that the framers of our Constitution, in their care to provide
that the law shall bind equally on all, and especially that those who
make them shall not exempt themselves from their operation, have only
privileged “Senators and Representatives” themselves from the single act
of “arrest in all cases except treason, felony and breach of the peace,
during their attendance at the session of their respective Houses, and
in going to and returning from the same, and from being questioned in
any other place for any speech or debate in either House.” _Const. U.
S., Art. 1, Sec. 6._ Under the general authority “to make all laws
necessary and proper for carrying into execution the powers given them,”
_Const. U. S., Art. 2, Sec. 8_, they may provide by law the details
which may be necessary for giving full effect to the enjoyment of this
privilege. No such law being as yet made, it seems to stand at present
on the following ground: 1. The act of arrest is void, ab initio.[3] 2.
The member arrested may be discharged on motion, 1 _Bl._ 166; 3 _Stra._,
990; or by habeas corpus under the Federal or State authority, as the
case may be; or by a writ of privilege out of the Chancery, 2 _Stra._,
989, in those States which have adopted that part of the laws of
England. _Orders of the House of Commons, 1550, February 20._ 3. The
arrest being unlawful, is a trespass for which the officers and others
concerned are liable to action and indictment in the ordinary courts of
justice, as in other cases of unauthorized arrest. 4. The court before
which the process is returnable is bound to act as in other cases of
unauthorized proceeding, and liable also, as in other similar cases, to
have their proceedings stayed or corrected by the superior courts.]

[The time necessary for going to, and returning from, Congress, not
being defined, it will, of course, be judged of in every particular case
by those who will have to decide the case.] While privilege was
understood in England to extend, as it does here, only to exemption from
arrest, eundo, moranda, et redeundo, the House of Commons themselves
decided that “a convenient time was to be understood.” (1580) 1 _Hats._,
99, 100. Nor is the law so strict in point of time as to require the
party to set out immediately on his return, but allows him time to
settle his private affairs, and to prepare for his journey; and does not
even scan his road very nicely, nor forfeit his protection for a little
deviation from that which is most direct; some necessity perhaps
constraining him to it. 2 _Stra._, 986, 987.

This privilege from arrest, privileges of course against all process,
the disobedience to which is punishable by an attachment of the person;
as a subpœna ad respondendum, or, testificandum, or a summons on a jury;
and with reason, because a member has superior duty to perform in
another place. [When a representative is withdrawn from his seat by
summons, the 40,000 people whom he represents lose their voice in debate
and vote, as they do on his voluntary absence; when a senator is
withdrawn by summons, his State loses half its voice in debate and vote,
as it does on his voluntary absence. The enormous disparity of evil
admits no comparison.]

[So far there will probably be no difference of opinion as to the
privileges of the two Houses of Congress; but in the following cases it
is otherwise. In December, 1795, the House of Representatives committed
two persons of the name of Randall and Whitney, for attempting to
corrupt the integrity of certain members, which they considered as a
contempt and breach of the privileges of the House; and the facts being
proved, Whitney was detained in confinement a fortnight, and Randall
three weeks, and was reprimanded by the Speaker. In March, 1796, the
House of Representatives voted a challenge given to a member of their
House to be a breach of the privileges of the House; but satisfactory
apologies and acknowledgments being made, no further proceeding was had.
The editor of the _Aurora_ having, in his paper of February 19, 1800,
inserted some paragraphs defamatory of the Senate, and failed in his
appearance, he was ordered to be committed. In debating the legality of
this order, it was insisted, in support of it, that every man, by the
law of nature, and every body of men, possesses the right of
self-defence; that all public functionaries are essentially invested
with the powers of self-preservation; that they have an inherent right
to do all acts necessary to keep themselves in a condition to discharge
the trusts confided to them; that whenever authorities are given, the
means of carrying them into execution are given by necessary
implication; that thus we see the British Parliament exercise the right
of punishing contempts; all the State Legislatures exercise the same
power, and every court does the same; that, if we have it not, we sit at
the mercy of every intruder who may enter our doors or gallery, and, by
noise and tumult, render proceeding in business impracticable; that if
our tranquility is to be perpetually disturbed by newspaper defamation,
it will not be possible to exercise our functions with the requisite
coolness and deliberation; and that we must, therefore, have a power to
punish these disturbers of our peace and proceedings. To this it was
answered, that the Parliament and courts of England have cognizance of
contempts by the express provisions of their law; that the State
Legislatures have equal authority, because their powers are plenary;
they represent their constituents completely, and possess all their
powers, except such as their Constitutions have expressly denied them;
that the courts of the several States have the same powers by the laws
of their States, and those of the Federal Government by the same State
laws adopted in each State, by a law of Congress; that none of these
bodies, therefore, derive those powers from natural or necessary right,
but from express law; that Congress have no such natural or necessary
power, nor any powers but such as are given them by the Constitution;
that that has given them, directly, exemption from personal arrest,
exemption from question elsewhere for what is said in their House, and
power over their own members and proceedings; for these no further law
is necessary, the Constitution being the law; that, moreover, by that
article of the Constitution which authorizes them “to make all laws
necessary and proper for carrying into execution the powers vested by
the Constitution in them,” they may provide by law for an undisturbed
exercise of their functions, e. g., for the punishment of contempts, of
affrays or tumult in their presence, &c.; but, till the law be made, it
does not exist; and does not exist, from their own neglect; that in the
mean time, however, they are not unprotected, the ordinary magistrates
and courts of law being open and competent to punish all unjustifiable
disturbances or defamations, and even their own sergeant, who may
appoint deputies _ad libitum_ to aid him, 3 _Grey_, 59, 147, 255, is
equal to small disturbances; that in requiring a previous law, the
Constitution had regard to the inviolability of the citizen, as well as
of the member; as, should one House, in the regular form of a bill, aim
at too broad privileges, it may be checked by the other, and both by the
President; and also as, the law being promulgated, the citizen will know
how to avoid offense. But if one branch may assume its own privileges
without control; if it may do it on the spur of the occasion, conceal
the law in its own breast, and after the fact committed, make its
sentence both the law and the judgment on that fact; if the offense is
to be kept undefined, and to be declared only _ex re nata_, and
according to the passion of the moment, and there be no limitation
either in the manner or measure of the punishment, the condition of the
citizen will be perilous indeed. Which of these doctrines is to prevail
time will decide. Where there is no fixed law, the judgment on any
particular case, is the law of that single case only, and dies with it.
When a new and even similar case arises, the judgment which is to make,
and at the same time apply, the law, is open to question and
consideration, as are all new laws. Perhaps Congress, in the meantime,
in their care for the safety of the citizen as well as that for their
own protection, may declare by law what is necessary and proper to
enable them to carry into execution the powers vested in them, and
thereby hang up a rule for the inspection of all, which may direct the
conduct of the citizen, and at the same time test the judgments they
shall themselves pronounce in their own case.]

Privilege from arrest takes place by force of the election; and before a
return be made a member elected may be named of a committee, and is to
every extent a member, except that he cannot vote until he is sworn.
_Memor._, 107, 108. _D’Ewes_, 642, _col._ 2; 643, _col._ 1. _Pet.
Miscel. Parl._, 119. _Lex. Parl. c._ 23. 2 _Hats._, 22, 62.

Every man must, at his peril, take notice who are members of either
House returned of record. _Lex. Parl._, 23; 4 _Inst._, 24.

On complaint of a breach of privilege, the party may either be summoned
or sent for in custody of the sergeant. _Grey_, 88, 95.

The privilege of a member is the privilege of the House. If the member
waive it without leave, it is a ground for punishing him, but cannot in
effect waive the privilege of the House. 3 _Grey_, 140, 222.

For any speech or debate in either House, they shall not be questioned
in any other place. _Const. U. S., I_, 6,; _S. P. protest of the Commons
to James I._, 1621; 2 _Rapin_, No. 54, pp. 211, 212. But this is
restrained to things done in the House in a parliamentary course. _1
Rush._, 663. For he is not to have privilege contra morem
parliamentarum, to exceed the bounds and limits of his place and duty.
_Com. p._

If an offense be committed by a member of the House, of which the House
has cognizance, it is an infringement of their right for any person or
court to take notice of it, till the House has punished the offender, or
referred him to a due course. _Lex. Parl._, 63.

Privilege is in the power of the House, and is a restraint to
proceedings of inferior courts, but not of the House itself. 2 _Nalson_,
450; 2 _Grey_, 399. For whatever is spoken in the House is subject to
the censure of the House; and offenses of this kind have been severely
punished by calling the person to the bar to make submission, committing
him to the tower, expelling the House, etc. _Scob._, 72; _L. Parl., c._
22.

It is a breach of order for the Speaker to refuse to put a question
which is in order. 2 _Hats._, 175-6; 5 _Grey_, 133.

And even in cases of treason, felony, and breach of the peace, to which
privilege does not extend as to substance, yet in Parliament a member
is privileged as to the mode of proceeding. The case is first to be laid
before the House, that it may judge of the fact and of the grounds of
the accusation, and how far forth the manner of the trial may concern
their privilege; otherwise it would be in the power of other branches of
the government, and even of every private man, under pretenses of
treason, etc., to take any man from his service in the House, and so as
many, one after another, as would make the House what he pleaseth. _Dec.
of the Com. on the King’s declaring Sir John Hotham a traitor._ 4
_Rushw._, 586. So, when a member stood indicted for felony, it was
adjudged that he ought to remain of the House till conviction; for it
may be any man’s case, who is guiltless, to be accused and indicted of
felony, or the like crime. _23 El._, 1580; _D’Ewes, 283, col._ 1; _Lex.
Parl._, 133.

When it is found necessary for the public service to put a member under
arrest, or when, on any public inquiry, matter comes out which may lead
to affect the person of a member, it is the practice immediately to
acquaint the House, that they may know the reasons for such a
proceeding, and take such steps as they think proper. 2 _Hats._, 259. Of
which see many examples. _Ib._, 256, 257, 258. But the communication is
subsequent to the arrest. 1 _Blackst._, 167.

It is highly expedient, says Hatsel, for the due preservation of the
privileges of the separate branches of the Legislature, that neither
should encroach on the other, or interfere in any matter depending
before them, so as to preclude, or even influence that freedom of
debate, which is essential to a free council. They are therefore not to
take notice of any bills or other matters depending, or of votes that
have been given, or of speeches which have been held, by the members of
either of the other branches of the Legislature, until the same have
been communicated to them in the usual parliamentary manner. 2 _Hats._,
252. 4 _Inst._, 15. _Seld. Jud._, 53. Thus the king’s taking notice of
the bill for suppressing soldiers, depending before the House; his
proposing a provisional clause for a bill before it was presented to him
by the two Houses; his expressing displeasure against some persons for
matters moved in parliament during the debate and preparation of a bill,
were breaches of privilege; 2 _Nalson_, 347; and in 1783, December 17,
it was declared a breach of fundamental privileges, etc., to report any
opinion or pretended opinion of the king on any bill or proceeding
depending in either House of Parliament, with a view to influence the
votes of the members. 2 _Hats._, 251, 6.


SECTION IV.

ELECTIONS.

[The times, places, and manner of holding elections for senators and
representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature
thereof; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such
regulations, except as to the places of choosing senators. _Const._ I.,
4.]

[Each House shall be the judge of the elections, returns, and
qualifications of its own members. _Const._ I., 5.]


SECTION V.

QUALIFICATIONS.

[The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from
each State, chosen by the Legislature thereof for six years; and each
Senator shall have one vote.]

[Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first
election, they shall be divided, as equally as may be into three
classes. The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated
at the end of the second year; of the second class, at the expiration of
the fourth year; and of the third class, at the expiration of the sixth
year; so that one-third may be chosen every second year; and if
vacancies happen, by resignation or otherwise, during the recess of the
Legislature of the State, any Executive thereof may make temporary
appointments, until the next meeting of the Legislature, which shall
then fill such vacancies.]

[No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the age of
thirty years, and been nine years a citizen of the United States, and
who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that State for which he
shall be chosen. _Const._ I., 3.]

[The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every
second year by the people of the several States; and the electors of
each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the
most numerous branch of the State Legislature.]

[No person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the
age of twenty-five years, and been seven years a citizen of the United
States, and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that State
in which he shall be chosen.]

[Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several
States which may be included within this Union, according to their
respective numbers; which shall be determined by adding to the whole
number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of
years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all other
persons. The actual enumeration shall be made within three years after
the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every
subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law
direct. The number of representatives shall not exceed one for every
thirty thousand, but each State shall have at least one representative.
_Constitution of the United States_, I., 2.]

The provisional apportionments of Representatives made in the
Constitution in 1787, and afterwards by Congress, were as follows:

[When vacancies happen in the representation from any State the
executive authority thereof shall issue writs of election to fill such
vacancies. _Const. U. S., Art. I, Sec. 2._]

[No Senator or Representative shall, during the time for which he was
elected, be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the
United States, which shall have been created, or the emoluments whereof
shall have been increased during such time; and no person, holding any
office under the United States, shall be a member of either House during
his continuance in office. _Const._ I, 6.]


SECTION VI.

QUORUM.

[A majority of each House shall constitute a quorum to do business; but
a smaller number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to
compel the attendance of absent members, in such manner and under such
penalties as each House may provide. _Const._ I, 5.]

[In general, the chair is not to be taken till a quorum for business is
present; unless, after due waiting, such a quorum be despaired of, when
the chair may be taken and the House adjourned. And whenever, during
business, it is observed that a quorum is not present, any member may
call for the House to be counted; and being found deficient, business is
suspended. 2 _Hats._, 125, 126.]

[The President having taken the chair, and a quorum being present, the
journal of the preceding day shall be read, to the end that any mistake
may be corrected that shall have been made in the entries. _Rules of the
Senate._]


SECTION VII.

CALL OF THE HOUSE.

On a call of the House, each person rises up as he is called and
answereth; the absentees are then only noted, but no excuse to be made
till the House be fully called a second time, and if still absent,
excuses are to be heard. _Ord. House of Commons_, 92.

They rise that their persons may be recognized; the voice in such a
crowd, being an insufficient verification of their presence. But in so
small a body as the Senate of the United States, the trouble of rising
cannot be necessary.


SECTION VIII.

ABSENCE.

[No member shall absent himself from the service of the Senate without
leave of the Senate first obtained. And in case a less number than a
quorum of the Senate shall convene, they are hereby authorized to send
the Sergeant-at-Arms, or any other person or persons by them authorized,
for any or all absent members, as the majority of such members present
shall agree, at the expense of such absent members, respectively,
unless such excuse for non-attendance shall be made as the Senate, when
a quorum is convened, shall judge sufficient; and in that case the
expense shall be paid out of the contingent fund. And this rule shall
apply as well to the first convention of the Senate, at the legal time
of meeting, as to each day of the session, after the hour is arrived to
which the Senate stood adjourned. _Rule 8._]


SECTION XI.

SPEAKER.

[The Vice-President of the United States shall be President of the
Senate, but shall have no vote unless they be equally divided.
_Constitution_, I, 3.]

[The Senate shall choose their officers, and also a President pro
tempore in the absence of the Vice-President, or when he shall exercise
the office of President of the United States. _Ib._]

[The House of Representatives shall choose their Speaker and other
officers. _Const._, I, 2.]

When but one person is proposed, and no objection made, it has not been
usual in Parliament to put any question to the House; but without a
question the members proposing him conduct him to the chair. But if
there be objection, or another proposed, a question is put by the clerk.

[In the Senate, a President pro tempore in the absence of the
Vice-President is proposed and chosen by ballot. His office is
understood to be determined on the Vice-President’s appearing and taking

Where the Speaker has been ill, other Speakers pro tempore have been
appointed. Instances of this are 1 _H._, 4. Sir John Cheyney, and for

SECTION X.

ADDRESS.

[The President shall, from time to time, give to the Congress
information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their
consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.
_Const._, II, 3.]

A joint address of both Houses of Parliament is read by the Speaker of
the House of Lords. It may be attended by both Houses in a body, or by a
committee from each House, or by the two Speakers only. An address of
the House of Commons only, may be presented by the whole House, or by
the Speaker, 9 _Grey_, 473; 1 _Chand._, 298, 301; or by such particular
members as are of the privy council. 2 _Hats._, 278.


SECTION XI.

COMMITTEES.

Standing committees, as of privileges and elections, etc., are usually
appointed at the first meeting, to continue through the session. The
person first named is generally permitted to act as chairman. But this
is a matter of courtesy; every committee having a right to elect their
own chairman, who presides over them, puts questions, and reports their
proceedings to the House. 4 _Inst._, 11, 12; _Scob._, 9; 1 _Grey_, 122.

At these committees the members are to speak standing, and not sitting;
though there is reason to conjecture it was formerly otherwise.
_D’Ewes_, 630, _col._ 1; 4 _Parl. Hist._, 440; 2 _Hats._, 77.

Their proceedings are not to be published, as they are of no force till
confirmed by the House. _Rushw., part 3, vol. 2_, 74; 3 _Grey_, 401;
_Scob._, 39. Nor can they receive a petition but through the House. _9
Grey_, 412.

When a committee is charged with an inquiry, if a member prove to be
involved, they cannot proceed against him, but must make a special
report to the House; whereupon the member is heard in his place, or at
the bar, or a special authority is given to the committee to inquire
concerning him. 9 _Grey_, 523.

So soon as the House sits, and a committee is notified of it, the
chairman is in duty bound to rise instantly, and the members to attend
the service of the House. 2 _Nals._, 319.

It appears that on joint committees of the Lords and Commons, each
committee acted integrally in the following instances: 7 _Grey_, 261,
278, 285, 338; 1 _Chandler_, 357, 462. In the following instances it
does not appear whether they did or not: 6 _Grey_, 129; 7 _Grey_, 213,
229, 321.[39]


SECTION XII.

COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE.

The speech, message, and other matters of great concernment, are usually
referred to a committee of the whole house, (6 _Grey_, 311,) where
general principles are digested in the form of resolutions, which are
debated and amended till they get into a shape which meets the
approbation of a majority. These being reported and confirmed by the
House, are then referred to one or more select committees, according as
the subject divides itself into one or more bills. _Scob._, 36, 44.
Propositions for any charge on the people are especially to be first
made in a committee of the whole. 3 _Hats._, 127. The sense of the whole
is better taken in committee, because in all committees every one speaks
as often as he pleases. _Scob._, 49. They generally acquiesce in the
chairman named by the Speaker; but, as well as all other committees,
have a right to elect one, some member, by consent, putting the
question. _Scob._, 36; 3 _Grey_, 301. The form of going from the House
into committee is for the Speaker, on motion, to put the question that
the House do now resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole, to take
into consideration such a matter, naming it. If determined in the
affirmative, he leaves the chair and takes a seat elsewhere, as any
other member; and the person appointed chairman seats himself at the
clerk’s table. _Scob._, 36. Their quorum is the same as that of the
House, and if a defect happens, the chairman, on a motion and question,
rises, the Speaker resumes the chair, and the chairman can make no other
report than to inform the House of the cause of their dissolution. If a
message is announced during a committee, the Speaker takes the chair,
and receives it, because the committee cannot. 2 _Hats._, 125, 126.

In a Committee of the Whole, the tellers, on a division, differing as to
numbers, great heats and confusion arose, and danger of a decision by
the sword. The Speaker took the chair, the mace was forcibly laid on the
table: whereupon the Members retiring to their places, the Speaker told
the House “he had taken the chair without an order to bring the House
into order.” Some excepted against it; but it was generally approved, as
the only expedient to suppress the disorder. And every member was
required, standing up in his place, to engage that he would proceed no
further, in consequence of what had happened in the grand committee,
which was done. 3 _Grey_, 128.

A Committee of the Whole being broken up in disorder, and the chair
resumed by the Speaker without an order, the House was adjourned. The
next day the committee was considered as thereby dissolved, and the
subject again before the House, and it was decided in the House, without
returning into committee. 3 _Grey_, 130.

No previous question can be put in a committee, nor can this committee
adjourn as others may; but if their business is unfinished, they rise,
on a question, the House is resumed, and the chairman reports that the
Committee of the Whole have, according to order, had under their
consideration such a matter, and have made progress therein; but not
having had time to go through the same, have directed him to ask leave
to sit again. Whereupon a question is put upon their having leave, and
on the time the House will again resolve itself into a committee.
_Scob._, 38. But if they have gone through the matter referred to them,
a member moves that the committee may rise, and the chairman report
their proceedings to the House; which being resolved, the chairman
rises, the Speaker resumes the chair, the chairman informs him that the
committee have gone through the business referred to them, and that he
is ready to make report when the House shall think proper to receive it.
If the House have time to receive it, there is usually a cry of “Now,
now,” whereupon he makes the report; but if it be late, the cry is,
“To-morrow, to-morrow,” or “Monday,” etc.; or a motion is made to that
effect, and a question put, that it be received to-morrow, etc. _Scob._,
38.

In other things the rules of proceedings are to be the same as in the
House. _Scob._, 39.


SECTION XIII.

EXAMINATION OF WITNESSES.

Common fame is a good ground for the House to proceed by inquiry, and
even to accusation. _Resolution House of Commons, 1 Car._, 1, 1624;
_Rush., L. Parl._, 115; 1 _Grey_, 16-22, 92; _Grey_, 21, 23, 27, 45.

Witnesses are not to be produced but where the House has previously
instituted an inquiry (2 _Hats._, 102), nor then are orders for their
attendance given blank. 3 _Grey_, 51.

When any person is examined before a committee, or at the bar of the
House, any member wishing to ask the person a question, must address it
to the Speaker or chairman, who repeats the question to the person, or
says to him, “You hear the question--answer it.” But if the propriety of
the question be objected to, the Speaker directs the witness, counsel,
and parties, to withdraw, for no question can be moved or put or debated
while they are there. 2 _Hats._, 108. Sometimes the questions are
previously settled in writing before the witness enters. _Ib._, 106,
107; 8 _Grey_, 64. The questions asked must be entered in the journals.
3 _Grey_, 81. But the testimony given in answer before the House is
never written down; but before a committee it must be, for the
information of the House, who are not present to hear it. 7 _Grey_, 52,
334.

If either house have occasion for the presence of a person in custody of
the other, they ask the other their leave that he may be brought up to
them in custody. 3 _Hats._, 52.

A member, in his place, gives information to the House of what he knows
of any matter under hearing at the bar. _Jour. H. of C., Jan. 22,
1744-45._

Either house may request, but not demand, the attendance of a member of
the other. They are to make the request by message to the other house,
and to express clearly the purpose of attendance, that no improper
subject of examination may be tendered to him. The House then gives
leave to the member to attend, if he chooses it; waiting first to know
from the member himself whether he chooses to attend, till which they do
not take the message into consideration. But when the peers are sitting
as a court of criminal judicature, they may order attendance, unless
where it be a case of impeachment by the Commons. There it is to be a
request. 3 _Hats._, 17; 9 _Grey_, 306, 406; _10 Grey_, 133.

Counsel are to be heard only on private, not on public bills, and on
such points of law only as the House shall direct. _10 Grey_, 61.


SECTION XIV.

ARRANGEMENT OF BUSINESS.

The Speaker is not precisely bound to any rules as to what bills or
other matter shall be first taken up; but is left to his own discretion,
unless the House on the question decide to take up a particular subject.
_Hakew._, 136.

A settled order of business is, however, necessary for the government of
the presiding person, and to restrain individual members from calling up
favorite measures, or matters under their special patronage, out of
their just turn. It is useful also for directing the discretion of the
House, when they are moved to take up a particular matter, to the
prejudice of the others having priority of right to their attention in
the general order of business.

[In Senate, the bills and other papers which are in possession of the
House, and in a state to be acted on, are arranged every morning, and
brought on in the following order:]

[1. Bills ready for a second reading are read, that they may be referred
to committees, and so be put under way. But if, on their being read, no
motion is made for commitment, they are then laid on the table in the
general file, to be taken up in their just turn.]

[2. After 12 o’clock, bills ready for it are put on their passage.]

[3. Reports in possession of the House, which offer grounds for a bill,
are to be taken up, that the bill may be ordered in.]

[4. Bills or other matters before the House, and unfinished on the
preceding day, whether taken up in turn or on special order, are
entitled to be resumed and passed on through their present stage.]

[5. These matters being dispatched, for preparing and expediting
business, the general file of bills and other papers is then taken up,
and each article of it is brought on according to its seniority,
reckoned by the date of its first introduction to the House. Reports on
bills belong to the dates of their bills.]

[The arrangement of the business of the Senate is now as follows:]

[1. Motions previously submitted.]

[2. Reports of Committees previously made.]

[3. Bills from the House of Representatives, and those introduced on
leave, which have been read the first time, are read the second time;
and if not referred to a committee, are considered in Committee of the
Whole, and proceeded with as in other cases.]

[4. After twelve o’clock, engrossed bills of the Senate, and bills of
the House of Representatives, on third reading, are put on their
passage.]

[5. If the above are finished before one o’clock, the general file of
bills, consisting of those reported from committees on the second
reading, and those reported from committees after having been referred,
are taken up in the order in which they were reported to the Senate by
the respective committees.]

[6. At one o’clock, if no business be pending, or if no motion be called
to proceed to other business, the special orders are called, at the head
of which stands the unfinished business of the preceding day.]

[In this way we do not waste our time in debating what shall be taken
up. We do one thing at a time; follow up a subject while it is fresh,
and till it is done with, clear the House of business gradatim as it is
brought on, and prevent, to a certain degree, its immense accumulation
towards the close of the session.]

[Arrangement, however, can only take hold of matters in possession of
the House. New matter may be moved at any time when no question is
before the House. Such are original motions and reports on bills. Such
are bills from the other House, which are received at all times, and
receive their first reading as soon as the question then before the
House is disposed of; and bills brought in on leave, which are read
first whenever presented. So messages from the other House respecting
amendments to bills are taken up as soon as the House is clear of a
question, unless they require to be printed, for better consideration.
Orders of the day may be called for, even when another question is
before the House.]


SECTION XV.

ORDER.

[Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings; punish its
members for disorderly behavior; and, with the concurrence of
two-thirds, expel a member. _Const._, I, 5.]

In Parliament, “Instances make order,” per Speaker Onslow. 2 _Hats._,
141. But what is done only by one Parliament, cannot be called custom of
Parliament; by Prynne. 1 _Grey_, 52.


SECTION XVI.

ORDER RESPECTING PAPERS.

The Clerk is to let no journals, records, accounts or papers, be taken
from the table or out of his custody. 2 _Hats._, 193, 194.

Mr. Prynne having at a Committee of the Whole amended a mistake in a
bill without order or knowledge of the committee, was reprimanded. _1
Chand._, 77.

A bill being missing, the House resolved that a protestation should be
made and subscribed by the members “before Almighty God and this
honorable House, that neither myself nor any other to my knowledge have
taken away, or do at this present conceal a bill entitled,” etc. _5
Grey_, 202.

After a bill is engrossed, it is put into the Speaker’s hands, and he is
not to let any one have it to look into. _Town._, _col._ 200.


SECTION XVII.

ORDER IN DEBATE.

When the Speaker is seated in his chair, every member is to sit in his
place. _Scob._, 6; 3 _Grey_, 403.

When any member means to speak, he is to stand up in his place,
uncovered, and to address himself, not to the House, or any particular
member, but to the speaker, who calls him by his name, that the House
may take notice who it is that speaks. _Scob._, 6; _D’Ewes_, 487; _col._
1; 2 _Hats._, 77; 4 _Grey_, 66; 8 _Grey_, 108. But members who are
indisposed may be indulged to speak sitting. 2 _Hats._, 75; 1 _Grey_,
143.

[In Senate, every member, when he speaks, shall address the chair,
standing in his place, and when he has finished, shall sit down. _Rule
3._]

When a member stands up to speak, no question is to be put, but he is
to be heard unless the House overrules him. 4 _Grey_, 390; 5 _Grey_, 6,
143.

If two or more rise to speak nearly together, the Speaker determines who
was first up, and calls him by name; whereupon he proceeds, unless he
voluntarily sits down and gives way to the other. But sometimes the
House does not acquiesce in the Speaker’s decision, in which case the
question is put, “Which member was first up?” 2 _Hats._, 76; _Scob._, 7;
_D’Ewes._, 434, _col._ 1, 2.

[In the Senate of the United States, the President’s decision is without
appeal. Their rule is in these words: _When two members rise at the same
time, the President shall name the person to speak; but in all cases_
the member who shall first rise and address the chair, shall speak
first. _Rule 5._]

No man may speak more than once on the same bill on the same day; or
even on another day, if the debate be adjourned. But if it be read more
than once in the same day, he may speak once at every reading. _Co._,
12, 115; _Hakew._, 148; _Scob._, 58; 2 _Hats._, 75. Even a change of
opinion does not give a right to be heard a second time. _Smyth’s Comw.,
L._ 2, _c._ 3; _Arcan Parl._, 17.

[The corresponding rule of the Senate is in these words: No member shall
speak more than twice, in any one debate on the same day, without leave
of the Senate. _Rule 4._]

But he may be permitted to speak again to a clear matter of fact (_3
Grey_, 357, 416); or merely to explain himself (2 _Hats._, 73) in some
material part of his speech (_Ib._ 75); or to the manner of words of the
question, keeping himself to that only, and not traveling into the
merits of it (_Memorials in Hakew._, 29), or to the orders of the House,
if they be transgressed, keeping within that line, and not falling into
the matter itself. _Mem. Hakew._, 30, 31.

But if the Speaker rise to speak, the member standing up ought to sit
down, that he may be first heard. _Town. col._, 205; _Hale Parl._, 133;
_Mem. in Hakew._, 30, 31. Nevertheless, though the Speaker may of right
speak to matters of order, and be first heard, he is restrained from
speaking on any other subject, except where the House have occasion for
facts within his knowledge; then he may with their leave, state the
matter of fact. 3 _Grey_, 38.

No one is to speak impertinently or beside the question, superfluously
or tediously. _Scob._, 31, 33; 2 _Hats._, 166, 168; _Hale Parl._, 133.

No person is to use indecent language against the proceedings of the
House; no prior determination of which is to be reflected on by any
member, unless he means to conclude with a motion to rescind it. _2
Hats._, 169, 170; _Rushw._, _p._ 3, _v._ 1, _fol._ 42. But while a
proposition under consideration is still in _fieri_, though it has even
been reported by a committee, reflections on it are no reflections on
the House. 9 _Grey_, 508.

No person in speaking, is to mention a member then present by his name,
but to describe him by his seat in the House, or who spoke last, or on
the other side of the question, etc. (_Mem. in Hakew._, 3; _Smyth’s
Comw._, _L._ 2, _c._ 3); nor to digress from the matter to fall upon the
person (_Scob._, 31; _Hale Parl._, 133; 2 _Hats._, 166) by speaking
reviling, nipping or unmanly words against a particular member. _Smyth’s
Comw._, _L._ 2, _c._ 3. The consequences of a measure may be reprobated
in strong terms; but to arraign the motives of those who propose to
advocate it, is a personality, and against order. _Qui digreditur a
materia ad personam_, Mr. Speaker ought to suppress. _Ord. Som., 1604,
Apr. 19._

[* * * When a member shall be called to order by the President or a
Senator, he shall sit down, and shall not proceed without leave of the
Senate; and every question of order shall be decided by the President,
without debate, subject to an appeal to the Senate; and the President
may call for the sense of the Senate on any question of order. _Rule
6._]

[No member shall speak to another or otherwise interrupt the business of
the Senate, or read any newspaper while the journals or public papers
are reading, or when any member is speaking in any debate. _Rule 2._]

No one is to disturb another in his speech by hissing, coughing,
spitting (6 _Grey_, 332; _Scob._, 8; _D’Ewes_, 332, _col._ 1, 640,
_col._ 1) speaking or whispering to another (_Scob._, 6; _D’Ewes_, 487,
_col._ 1); nor stand up to interrupt him (_Town._, _col._ 205; _Mem. in
Hakew._, 31); nor to push between the Speaker and the speaking member,
nor to go across the house (_Scob._, 6), or to walk up and down it, or
to take books or papers from the table, or write there. 2 _Hats._, 171.

Nevertheless, if a member finds that it is not the inclination of the
House to hear him, and that by conversation or any other noise they
endeavor to drown his voice, it is his most prudent way to submit to the
pleasure of the House, and sit down; for it scarcely ever happens that
they are guilty of this piece of ill manners without sufficient reason,
or inattentive to a member who says anything worth their hearing. _2
Hats._, 77, 78.

If repeated calls do not produce order, the Speaker may call by his name
any member obstinately persisting in irregularity; whereupon the House
may require the member to withdraw. He is then to be heard in
exculpation, and to withdraw. Then the Speaker states the offense
committed, and the House considers the degree of punishment they will
inflict. 3 _Hats._, 167, 7, 8, 172.

For instances of assaults and affrays in the House of Commons, and the
proceedings thereon, see 1 _Pet. Misc._, 82; 3 _Grey_, 128; 4 _Grey_,
328; 5 _Grey_, 382; 6 _Grey_, 254; _10 Grey_, 8.

Whenever warm words or an assault have passed between members, the
House, for the protection of their members, requires them to declare in
their places not to prosecute any quarrel (3 _Grey_, 127, 293; 5 _Grey_,
280); or orders them to attend the Speaker, who is to accommodate their
differences, and report to the House (3 _Grey_, 419); and they are put
under restraint if they refuse, or until they do. 9 _Grey_, 234, 312.

Disorderly words are not to be noticed till the member has finished his
speech. 5 _Grey_, 356; 6 _Grey_, 60. Then the person objecting to them,
and desiring them to be taken down by the clerk at the table, must
repeat them. The Speaker then may direct the clerk to take them down in
his minutes; but if he thinks them not disorderly, he delays the
direction. If the call becomes pretty general, he orders the clerk to
take them down, as stated by the objecting member. They are then part of
his minutes, and when read to the offending member, he may deny they
were his words, and the House must then decide by a question whether
they are his words or not. Then the member may justify them, or explain
the sense in which he used them, or apologize. If the House is
satisfied, no further proceeding is necessary. But if two members still
insist to take the sense of the House, the member must withdraw before
that question is stated, and then the sense of the House is to be taken.
2 _Hats._, 199; 4 _Grey_, 170; 6 _Grey_, 59. When any member has spoken,
or other business intervenes, after offensive words spoken, they cannot
be taken notice of for censure. And this is for the common security of
all, and to prevent mistakes which must happen if words are not taken
down immediately. Formerly they might be taken down at any time the same
day. 2 _Hats._, 196; _Mem. in Hakew._, 71; 3 _Grey_, 48; 9 _Grey_, 514.

Disorderly words spoken in a committee must be written down as in the
House; but the committee can only report them to the House for
animadversion. 6 _Grey_, 46.

[The rule of the Senate says: “If the member be called to order by a
senator for words spoken, the exceptional words shall immediately be
taken down in writing, that the President may be better enabled to judge
of the matter.” _Rule 7._]

In Parliament, to speak irreverently or seditiously against the King, is
against order. _Smyth’s Comw._, _L._ 2, _c._ 3; 2 _Hats._, 170.

It is a breach of order in debate to notice what has been said on the
same subject in the other house, or the particular votes or majorities
on it there; because the opinion of each house should be left to its own
independency, not to be influenced by the proceedings of the other; and
the quoting them might beget reflections leading to a misunderstanding
between the two houses. 8 _Grey_, 22.

Neither house can exercise any authority over a member or officer of the
other, but should complain to the house of which he is, and leave the
punishment to them. Where the complaint is of words disrespectfully
spoken by a member of another house, it is difficult to obtain
punishment, because of the rules supposed necessary to be observed (as
to the immediate noting down of words) for the security of members.
Therefore it is the duty of the House, and more particularly of the
Speaker, to interfere immediately, and not to permit expressions to go
unnoticed, which may give a ground of complaint to the other house, and
introduce proceedings and mutual accusations between the two houses,
which can hardly be terminated without difficulty and disorder. _3
Hats._, 51.

No member may be present when a bill or any business concerning himself
is debating; nor is any member to speak to the merits of it till he
withdraws. 2 _Hats._, 219. The rule is, that if a charge against a
member arise out of a report of a committee, or examination of witnesses
in the House, as the member knows from that to what points he is to
direct his exculpation, he may be heard to those points before any
question is moved or stated against him. He is then to be heard, and
withdraw before any question is moved. But if the question itself is the
charge, as for breach of order, or matter arising in the debate, then
the charge must be stated, (that is, the question must be moved,)
himself heard, and then to withdraw. 2 _Hats._, 121, 122.

Where the private interests of a member are concerned in a bill or
question, he is to withdraw. And where such an interest has appeared,
his voice has been disallowed, even after a division. In a case so
contrary, not only to the laws of decency, but to the fundamental
principle of the social compact which denies to any man to be a judge in
his own cause, it is for the honor of the House that this rule of
immemorial observance, should be strictly adhered to. 2 _Hats._, 119,
121; 6 _Grey_, 368.

No member is to come into the house with his head covered, nor to
remove from one place to another with his hat on, nor is to put on his
hat in coming in or removing, until he be set down in his place.
_Scob._, 6.

A question of order may be adjourned to give time to look into
precedents. 2 _Hats._, 118.

In Parliament all decisions of the Speaker may be controlled by the
House. 3 _Grey_, 319.


SECTION XVIII.

ORDERS OF THE HOUSE.

Of right, the doors of the House ought not to be shut, but to be kept by
porters, or sergeant-at-arms, assigned for that purpose. _Mod. Ten.
Parl._, 23.

[By the rules of the Senate, on motion made and seconded to shut the
doors of the Senate on the discussion of any business which may, in the
opinion of a member, require secrecy, the President shall direct the
gallery to be cleared; and during the discussion of such motion the
doors shall remain shut. _Rule 18._]

No motion shall be deemed in order to admit any person or persons
whatsoever, within the doors of the Senate chamber, to present any
petition, memorial or address, or to hear any such read. _Rule 19._

[The only case where a member has a right to insist on anything, is
where he calls for the execution of a subsisting order of the House.
Here, there having been already a resolution, any person has a right to
insist that the Speaker, or any other whose duty it is, shall carry it
into execution; and no debate or delay can be had on it. Thus any member
has a right to have the House or gallery cleared of strangers, an order
existing for that purpose; or to have the House told where there is not
a quorum present. 2 _Hats._, 87, 129. How far an order of the House is
binding. See _Hakew._, 392.]

But where an order is made that any particular matter be taken up on a
particular day, there a question is to be put, when it is called for,
whether the House will now proceed to that matter? Where orders of the
day are on important or interesting matter, they ought not to be
proceeded on till an hour at which the House is usually full, [_which in
Senate is at noon_.]

Orders of the day may be discharged at any time, and a new one made for
a different day. 3 _Grey_, 48, 313.

When a session is drawing to a close, and the important bills are all
brought in, the House, in order to prevent interruption by further
unimportant bills, sometimes come to a resolution that no new bill be
brought in, except it be sent from the other house. 3 _Grey_, 156.

All orders of the House determine with the session; and one taken under
such an order may, after the session is ended, be discharged on a habeas
corpus. _Raym._, 120; _Jacob’s L. D. by Ruffhead_; _Parliament, 1 Lev._,
165, (_Pritchard’s case_.)

[Where the Constitution authorizes each House to determine the rules of
its proceedings, it must mean in those cases (legislative, executive or
judiciary) submitted to them by the Constitution, or in something
relating to these, and necessary towards their execution. But orders and
resolutions are sometimes entered in the journals, having no relation to
these, such as acceptances of invitations to attend orations, to take
part in processions, etc. These must be understood to be merely
conventional among those who are willing to participate in the ceremony,
and are, therefore, perhaps, improperly placed among the records of the
House.]


SECTION XIX.

PETITIONS.

A petition prays something. A remonstrance has no prayer. 1 _Grey_, 58.

Petitions must be subscribed by the petitioners (_Scob._, 87; _L.
Parl._, _c._ 22; 9 _Grey_, 362), unless they are attending (1 _Grey_,
401); or unable to sign, and averred by a member (3 _Grey_, 418). But a
petition not subscribed, but which the member presenting it affirmed to
be all in the handwriting of the petitioner, and his name written in the
beginning, was on the question (Mar. 14, 1800) received by the Senate.
The averment of a member, or of somebody withoutdoors, that they know
the handwriting of the petitioners, is necessary, if it be questioned
(6 _Grey_, 36). It must be presented by a member, not by the
petitioners, and must be opened by him holding it in his hand. _10
Grey_, 57.

[Before any petition or memorial addressed to the Senate shall be
received and read at the table, whether the same shall be introduced by
the President or a member, a brief statement of the contents of the
petition or memorial shall verbally be made by the introducer. _Rule
24._]

Regularly, a motion for receiving it must be made and seconded, and a
question put, whether it shall be received? But a cry from the House of
“Received,” or even its silence, dispenses with the formality of this
question; it is then to be read at the table, and disposed of.


SECTION XX.

MOTIONS.

When a motion has been made it is not to be put to the question, or
debated until it is seconded. _Scob._, 21.

[The Senate say: No motion shall be debated until the same shall be
seconded. _Rule 9._]

It is then, and not till then, in possession of the House, and cannot be
withdrawn but by leave of the House. It is to be put into writing, if
the House or Speaker require it, and must be read to the House by the
Speaker as often as any member desires it for his information. _2
Hats._, 82.

[The rule of the Senate is: When a motion shall be made and seconded, it
shall be reduced to writing, if desired by the President or any member,
delivered in at the table, and read, before the same shall be debated.
* * * _Rule 10._]

It might be asked, whether a motion for adjournment or for the orders of
the day, can be made by any one member while another is speaking. It
cannot. When two members offer to speak, he who rose first is to be
heard; and it is a breach of order in another to interrupt him, unless
by calling him to order if he departs from it. And the question of order
being decided, he is still to be heard through. A call for adjournment,
or for the order of the day, or for the question, by gentlemen from
their seats, is not a motion. No motion can be made without arising and
addressing the chair. Such calls are themselves breaches of order,
which, though the member who has risen may respect as an expression of
impatience of the House against further debate, yet, if he chooses, he
has a right to go on.


SECTION XXI.

RESOLUTIONS.

When the House commands, it is by an “order.” But facts, principles, and
their own opinions and purposes, are expressed in the form of
resolutions.

[A resolution for an allowance of money to the clerks being moved, it
was objected to as not in order, and so ruled by the Chair; but on an
appeal to the Senate (_i. e._, a call for their sense by the President,
on account of doubt in his mind, according to rule 26), the decision was
overruled, _Jour. Sen., June 1, 1796_. I presume the doubt was, whether
an allowance of money could be made otherwise than by bill.]


SECTION XXII.

BILLS.

[Every bill shall receive three readings previous to its being passed;
and the President shall give notice at each whether it be first, second
or third; which readings shall be on three different days, unless the
Senate unanimously direct otherwise. * * * _Rule 26._]


SECTION XXIII.

BILLS--LEAVE TO BRING IN.

[One day’s notice, at least, shall be given of an intended motion for
leave to bring in a bill. _Rule 25._]

When a member desires to bring in a bill on any subject, he states to
the House in general terms the causes for doing it, and concludes by
moving for leave to bring in a bill entitled, etc. Leave being given on
the question, a committee is appointed to prepare and bring in the bill.
The mover and seconder are always appointed of this committee, and one
or more in addition. _Hakew._, 122; _Scob._, 40.

It is to be presented fairly written, without any other erasure or
interlineation, or the Speaker may refuse it. _Scob._, 41; 1 _Grey_, 82,
84.


SECTION XXIV.

BILLS--FIRST READING.

When a bill is first presented, the clerk reads it at the table, and
hands it to the Speaker, who, rising, states to the House the title of
the bill; that this is the first time of reading it; and the question
will be, whether it shall be read a second time? then sitting down to
give an opening for objections. If none be made, he rises again, and
puts the question, whether it shall be read a second time? _Hakew._,
137, 141. A bill cannot be amended on the first reading, (6 _Grey_,
286;) nor is it usual for it to be opposed then, but it may be done and
rejected. _D’Ewes_, 335, _col_ 1; 3 _Hats._, 198.


SECTION XXV.

BILLS--SECOND READING.

The second reading must regularly be on another day. _Hakew._, 143. It
is done by the Clerk at the table, who then hands it to the Speaker. The
Speaker rising, states to the House the title of the bill; that this is
the second time of reading it; and that the question will be, whether it
shall be committed or engrossed and read a third time? But if the bill
came from the other House, as it always comes engrossed, he states that
the question will be, whether it shall be read a third time? and before
he has so reported the state of the bill, no one is to speak to it.
_Hakew._, 143, 146.

[In the Senate of the United States, the President reports the title of
the bill; that this is the second time of reading it; that it is now to
be considered as in a Committee of the Whole; and the question will be,
whether it shall be read a third time? or that it may be referred to a
special committee?]


SECTION XXVI.

BILLS--COMMITMENT.

If on motion and question it be decided that the bill shall be
committed, it may then be moved to be referred to Committee of the Whole
House, or to a special committee. If the latter, the Speaker proceeds to
name the committee. Any member also may name a single person, and the
clerk is to write him down as of the committee. But the House have a
controlling power over the names and number, if a question be moved
against anyone; and may in any case put in and put out whom they please.

Those who take exceptions to some particulars in the bill are to be of
the committee, but none who speak directly against the body of the bill;
for he that would totally destroy will not amend it, (_Hakew._, 146;
_Town._, _col._ 208; _D’Ewes_, 634, _col._ 2; _Scob._, 47;) or, as it is
said, (5 _Grey_, 145,) the child is not to be put to a nurse that cares
not for it, (6 _Grey_, 373.) It is therefore a constant rule “that no
man is to be employed in any matter who has declared himself against
it.” And when any member, who is against the bill, hears himself named
to its committee, he ought to ask to be excused. Thus (March 7, 1606)
Mr. Hadley was, on the question being put, excused from being of a
committee, declaring himself to be against the matter itself. _Scob._,
46.

[No bill shall be committed or amended until it shall have been twice
read; after which it may be referred to a committee. _Rule 27._]

[In the appointment of the standing committees, the Senate will proceed,
by ballot, severally to appoint the Chairman of each committee; and
then, by one ballot, the other members necessary to complete the same;
and a majority of the whole number of votes given shall be necessary to
the choice of a chairman of a standing committee. All other committees
shall be appointed by ballot, and a plurality of votes shall make a
choice. When any subject or matter shall have been referred to a
committee, any other subject or matter of a similar nature, may, on
motion, be referred to such committee. _Rule 34._]

The clerk may deliver the bill to any member of the committee, (_Town._,
_col._ 138;) but it is usual to deliver it to him who is first named.

In some cases the House has ordered a committee to withdraw immediately
into the Committee Chamber, and act on and bring back the bill, sitting
in the House. _Scob._, 48. A committee meet when and where they please,
if the House has not ordered time and place for them, (6 _Grey_, 370;)
but they can only act when together, and not by separate consultation
and consent--nothing being the report of the committee but what has been
agreed to in committee actually assembled.

A majority of the committee constitutes a quorum for business.
_Elsynge’s Method of Passing Bills_, 11.

Any member of the House may be present at any select committee, but
cannot vote, and must give place to all of the committee, and sit below
them. _Elsynge_, 12; _Scob._, 49.

The committee have full power over the bill or other paper committed to
them, except that they cannot change the title or subject. 8 _Grey_,
228.

The paper before a committee, whether select or of the whole, may be a
bill, resolutions, draught of an address, etc., and it may either
originate with them or be referred to them. In every case the whole
paper is read first by the clerk, and then by the chairman, by
paragraphs, (_Scob._, 49,) pausing at the end of each paragraph, and
putting questions for amending, if proposed. In the case of resolutions
on distinct subjects, originating with themselves, a question is put on
each separately, as amended or unamended, and no final question on the
whole. (3 _Hats._, 276;) but if they relate to the same subject, a
question is put on the whole. If it be a bill, draught of an address, or
other paper originating with them, they proceed by paragraphs; putting
questions for amending either by insertion or striking out, if proposed;
but no question on agreeing to the paragraphs separately; this is
reserved to the close, when a question is put on the whole for agreeing
to it as amended or unamended. But if it be a paper referred to them,
they proceed to put questions of amendment, if proposed, but no final
question on the whole, because all parts of the paper, having been
adopted by the House, stand, of course, unless altered or struck out by
a vote. Even if they are opposed to the whole paper, and think it cannot
be made good by amendments, they cannot reject it, but must report it
back to the House without amendments, and there make their opposition.

The natural order in considering and amending any paper is, to begin at
the beginning, and proceed through it by paragraphs, and this order is
so strictly adhered to in Parliament, that when a latter part has been
amended, you cannot recur back and make any alterations in a former
part. 2 _Hats._, 90. In numerous assemblies this restraint is doubtless
important. [But in the Senate of the United States, though in the main
we consider and amend the paragraphs in their natural order, yet
recurrences are indulged; and they seem, on the whole, in that small
body, to produce advantages overweighing their inconveniences.]

To this natural order of beginning at the beginning, there is a single
exception found in parliamentary usage. When a bill is taken up in
committee, or on its second reading, they postpone the preamble till the
other parts of the bill are gone through. The reason is, that on
consideration of the body of the bill, such alterations may therein be
made as may also occasion the alteration of the preamble. _Scob._, 50;
7 _Grey_, 431.

On this head the following case occurred in the Senate, March 6, 1800: A
resolution which had no preamble having been already amended by the
House so that a few words only of the original remained in it, a motion
was made to prefix a preamble, which having an aspect very different
from the resolution, the mover intimated that he should afterwards
propose a corresponding amendment in the body of the resolution. It was
objected that a preamble could not be taken up till the body of the
resolution is done with; but the preamble was received, because we are
in fact through the body of the resolution; we have amended that as far
as amendments have offered, and, indeed, till little of the original is
left. It is the proper time, therefore, to consider a preamble; and
whether the one offered be consistent with the resolution is for the
House to determine. The mover, indeed, has intimated that he shall offer
a subsequent proposition for the body of the resolution; but the House
is not in possession of it; it remains in his breast, and may be
withheld. The rules of the House can only operate on what is before
them. [The practice of the Senate, too, allows recurrences backwards and
forwards, for the purposes of amendment, not permitting amendments in a
subsequent to preclude those in a prior part, or _e converso_.]

When the committee is through the whole, a member moves that the
committee may rise, and the chairman report the paper to the House, with
or without amendments, as the case may be. 2 _Hats._, 289, 292; _Scob._,
53; 2 _Hats._, 290; 8 _Scob._, 50.

When a vote is once passed in a committee, it cannot be altered but by
the House, their votes being binding on themselves. _1607, June 4._

The committee may not erase, interline, or blot the bill itself; but
must, in a paper by itself, set down the amendments, stating the words
which are to be inserted or omitted (_Scob._, 50), and where, by
references to the page, line, and word of the bill. _Scob._, 50.


SECTION XXVII.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE.

The chairman of the committee, standing in his place, informs the House
that the committee, to whom was referred such a bill, have, according to
order, had the same under consideration, and have directed him to report
the same without any amendment or with sundry amendments (as the case
may be), which he is ready to do when the House pleases to receive it.
And he or any other may move that it be now received; but the cry of
“now, now,” from the House, generally dispenses with the formality of a
motion and question. He then reads the amendment, with the coherence in
the bill, and opens the alterations and the reasons of the committee for
such amendments, until he has gone through the whole. He then delivers
it at the clerk’s table, where the amendments reported are read by the
clerk without the coherence; whereupon the papers lie upon the table
till the House, at its convenience, shall take up the report. _Scob._,
52; _Hakew._, 148.

The report being made, the committee is dissolved and can act no more
without a new power. _Scob._, 51. But it may be revived by a vote, and
the same matter recommitted to them. 4 _Grey_, 361.


SECTION XXVIII.

BILL--RECOMMITMENT.

After a bill has been committed and reported, it ought not in an
ordinary course to be recommitted; but in cases of importance, and for
special reasons, it is sometimes recommitted, and usually to the same
committee. _Hakew._, 151. If a report be recommitted before agreed to in
the House, what has passed in committee is of no validity; the whole
question is again before the committee, and a new resolution must be
again moved, as if nothing had passed. 2 _Hats._, 131--_note_.

In Senate, January, 1800, the salvage bill was recommitted three times
after the commitment.

A particular clause of a bill may be committed without the whole bill
(3 _Hats._, 131); or so much of a paper to one and so much to another
committee.


SECTION XXIX.

BILL--REPORTS TAKEN UP.

When the report of a paper originating with a committee is taken up by
the House, they proceed exactly as in committee. Here, as in committee,
when the paragraphs have, on distinct questions, been agreed to
_seriatim_ (5 _Grey_, 366; 6 _Grey_, 368; 8 _Grey_, 47, 104, 360; _1
Torbuck’s Deb._, 125; 3 _Hats._, 348), no question need be put on the
whole report. 5 _Grey_, 381.

On taking up a bill reported with amendments, the amendments only are
read by the Clerk. The Speaker then reads the first, and puts it to the
question, and so on until the whole are adopted or rejected, before any
other amendment be admitted, except it be an amendment to an amendment.
_Elsynge’s Mem._, 53. When through the amendments of the committee, the
Speaker pauses, and gives time for amendments to be proposed in the
House to the body of the bill as he does also if it has been reported
without amendments, putting no questions but on amendments proposed; and
when through the whole, he puts the question whether the bill be read
the third time.


SECTION XXX.

QUASI-COMMITTEE.

If on motion and question the bill be not committed, or if no
proposition for commitment be made, then the proceedings in the Senate
of the United States and in Parliament are totally different. The former
shall be first stated.

[The 28th rule of the Senate says: “All bills on a second reading shall
first be considered by the Senate in the same manner as if the Senate
were in Committee of the Whole, before they shall be taken up and
proceeded on by the Senate agreeably to the standing rules, unless
otherwise ordered;” (that is to say, unless ordered to be referred to a
special committee.) And when the Senate shall consider a treaty, bill,
or resolution, as in Committee of the Whole, the Vice-President or
President _pro tempore_ may call a member to fill the chair during the
time the Senate shall remain in Committee of the Whole; and the chairman
(so called) shall, during such time, have the powers of a President _pro
tempore_.]

[The proceedings of the Senate, as in a Committee of the Whole, or in
Quasi-Committee, are precisely as in a real Committee of the Whole,
taking no questions but on amendments. When through the whole, they
consider the Quasi-Committee as risen, the House resumes without any
motion, question, or resolution to that effect, and the President
reports that “The House acting as in Committee of the Whole, have had
under their consideration the bill entitled, etc., and have made sundry
amendments, which he will now report to the House.” The bill is then
before them, as it would have been if reported from a committee, and the
questions are regularly to be put again on every amendment; which being
gone through, the President pauses to give time to the House to propose
amendments to the body of the bill, and when through, puts the question
whether it shall be read a third time.]

[After progress in amending the bill in Quasi-Committee, a motion may be
made to refer it to a special committee. If the motion prevails, it is
equivalent in effect to the several votes, that the committee rise, the
House resume itself, discharge the Committee of the Whole, and refer the
bill to a special committee. In that case, the amendments already made,
fall. But if the motion falls, the Quasi-Committee stands _in statu
quo_.]

[How far does this 28th rule subject the House, when in Quasi-Committee,
to the laws which regulate the proceedings of Committees of the Whole?]
The particulars in which these differ from proceedings in the House are
the following: 1. In a committee every member may speak as often as he
pleases. 2. The votes of a committee may be rejected or altered when
reported to the House. 3. A committee, even of the Whole, cannot refer
any matter to another committee. 4. In a committee no previous question
can be taken: the only means to avoid an improper discussion is to move
that the committee rise; and if it be apprehended that the same
discussion will be attempted on returning into committee, the House can
discharge them, and proceed itself on the business, keeping down the
improper discussions by the previous question. 5. A committee cannot
punish a breach of order in the House, or in the gallery. 9 _Grey_, 113.
It can only rise and report it to the House, who may proceed to punish.
[The first and second of these peculiarities attach to the
Quasi-Committee of the Senate, as every day’s practice proves, and seem
to be the only ones to which the 28th rule meant to subject them; for it
continues to be a House, and therefore, though it acts in some respects
as a committee, in others it preserves its character as House. Thus: 3.
It is in the daily habit of referring its business to a special
committee. 4. It admits of the previous question; if it did not, it
would have no means of preventing an improper discussion, not being
able, as a committee is, to avoid it by returning into the House, for
the moment it would resume the same subject there, the 28th rule
declares it again a Quasi-Committee. 5. It would doubtless exercise its
powers as a house on any breach of order. 6. It takes a question by yea
and nay, as the House does. 7. It receives messages from the President
and the other House. 8. In the midst of a debate it receives a motion to
adjourn, and adjourns as a house, not a committee.]


SECTION XXXI.

BILLS--SECOND READING IN THE HOUSE.

In Parliament, after the bill has been read a second time, if on the
motion and question it be not committed, or if no proposition for
commitment be made, the Speaker reads it by paragraphs, pausing between
each, but putting no question but on amendments proposed; and when
through the whole, he puts the question whether it shall be read a third
time? if it come from the other House; or, if originating with
themselves, whether it shall be engrossed and read a third time? The
Speaker reads sitting, but rises to put questions. The clerk stands
while he reads.

[[40]But the Senate of the United States is so much in the habit of
making many and material amendments at the third reading, that it has
become the practice not to engross a bill till it has passed--an
irregular and dangerous practice, because in this way the paper which
passes the Senate is not that which goes to the other House, and that
which goes to the other House as the act of the Senate has never been
seen in Senate. In reducing numerous, difficult, and illegible
amendments into the text, the Secretary may with the most innocent
intentions, commit errors which can never again be corrected.]

The bill being now as perfect as its friends can make it, this is the
proper stage for those fundamentally opposed to make their first attack.
All attempts at earlier periods are with disjointed efforts, because
many who do not expect to be in favor of the bill ultimately are willing
to let it go on to its perfect state, to take time to examine it
themselves and to hear what can be said for it, knowing that after all,
they will have sufficient opportunities of giving it their veto. Its
last two stages, therefore, are reserved for this--that is to say, on
the question whether it shall be engrossed and read a third time, and
lastly, whether it shall pass? The first of these is usually the most
interesting contest, because then the whole subject is new and engaging;
and the minds of the members having not yet been declared by any trying
vote, the issue is the more doubtful. In this stage, therefore, is the
main trial of strength between its friends and opponents, and it
behooves every one to make up his mind decisively for this question, or
he loses the main battle; and accident and management may, and often do,
prevent a successful rallying on the next and last question, whether it
shall pass.

When the bill is engrossed, the title is to be endorsed on the back and
not within the bill. _Hakew._, 250.


SECTION XXXII.

READING PAPERS.

Where papers are laid before the House or referred to a committee, every
member has a right to have them once read at the table before he can be
compelled to vote on them; but it is a great though common error to
suppose that he has a right _toties quoties_, to have acts, journals,
accounts, or papers on the table, read independently of the will of the
House. The delay and interruption which this might be made to produce,
evince the impossibility of the existence of such a right. There is,
indeed, so manifest a propriety of permitting every member to have as
much information as possible on every question on which he is to vote,
that when he desires the reading, if it be seen that it is really for
information and not for delay, the Speaker directs it to be read without
putting a question, if no one objects; but if objected to, a question
must be put. 2 _Hats._, 117, 118.

It is equally an error to suppose that any member has a right, without a
question put, to lay a book or paper on the table, or have it read, on
suggesting that it contains matter infringing on the privileges of the
House. _Ib._

For the same reason a member has not a right to read a paper in his
place, if it be objected to, without leave of the House. But this rigor
is never exercised but where there is an intentional or gross abuse of
the time and patience of the House.

A member has not a right even to read his own speech, committed to
writing, without leave. This also is to prevent an abuse of time, and
therefore is not refused but where that is intended. 2 _Grey_, 226.

A report of a committee of the Senate on a bill from the House of
Representatives being under consideration, on motion that the report of
the committee of the House of Representatives on the same bill be read
in the Senate, it passed in the negative. _Feb. 28, 1793._

Formerly when papers were referred to a committee, they used to be first
read; but of late only the titles, unless a number insist that they
shall be read, and then nobody can oppose it. 2 _Hats._, 117.


SECTION XXXIII.

PRIVILEGED QUESTIONS.

[[41] While a question is before the Senate, no motion shall be
received, unless for an amendment, for the previous question, or for
postponing the main question, or to commit it, or to adjourn. _Rule 8._]

It is no possession of a bill unless it be delivered to the Clerk to be
read, or the Speaker reads the title. _Lex. Parl._, 273; _Elsynge’s
Mem._, 85; _Ord. House of Commons_, 64.

It is a general rule that the question first moved and seconded shall be
first put. _Scob._, 28, 22; 2 _Hats._, 81. But this rule gives way to
what may be called privileged questions; and the privileged questions
are of different grades among themselves.

A motion to adjourn simply takes place of all others, for otherwise the
House might be kept sitting against its will, and indefinitely. Yet this
motion cannot be received after another question is actually put, and
while the House is engaged in voting.

Orders of the day take place of all other questions, except for
adjournment--that is to say, the question which is the subject of an
order is made a privileged one, _pro hac vice_. The order is a repeal of
the general rule as to this special case. When any member moves,
therefore, for the Order of the Day to be read, no further debate is
permitted on the question which was before the House; for if the debate
might proceed, it might continue through the day and defeat the order.
This motion, to entitle it to precedence, must be for the orders
generally, and not for any particular one; and if it be carried on the
question, “Whether the House will now proceed to the orders of the day?”
they must be read and proceeded on in the course in which they stand (_2
Hats._, 83), for priority of order gives priority of right, which cannot
be taken away but by another special order.

After these there are other privileged questions, which will require
considerable explanation.

It is proper that every parliamentary assembly should have certain forms
of questions, so adapted as to enable them fitly to dispose of every
proposition which can be made to them. Such are: 1. The previous
question. 2. To postpone indefinitely. 3. To adjourn a question to a
definite day. 4. To lie on the table. 5. To commit. 6. To amend. The
proper occasion for each of these questions should be understood.

1. When a proposition is moved which it is useless or inexpedient now to
express or discuss, the previous question has been introduced for
suppressing for that time the motion and its discussion. 3 _Hats._, 188,
189.

2. But as the previous question gets rid of it only for that day, and
the same proposition may recur the next day, if they wish to suppress it
for the whole of that session, they postpone it indefinitely. 3 _Hats._,
183. This quashes the proposition for that session, as an indefinite
adjournment is a dissolution, or the continuance of a suit sine die is a
discontinuance of it.

3. When a motion is made which it will be proper to act on, but
information is wanted, or something more pressing claims the present
time, the question or debate is adjourned to such day within the session
as will answer the views of the House. 2 _Hats._, 81. And those who have
spoken before may not speak again when the adjourned debate is resumed.
2 _Hats._, 73. Sometimes, however, this has been abusedly used by
adjourning it to a day beyond the session, to get rid of it altogether,
as would be done by an indefinite postponement.

4. When the House has something else which claims its present attention,
but would be willing to reserve in their power to take up a proposition
whenever it shall suit them, they order it to lie on the table. It may
then be called for at any time.

5. If the proposition will want more amendment and digestion than the
formalities of the House will conveniently admit, they refer it to a
committee.

6. But if the proposition be well digested, and may need but few and
simple amendments, and especially if these be of leading consequence,
they then proceed to consider and amend it themselves.

The Senate, in their practice, vary from this regular gradation of
forms. Their practice comparatively with that of Parliament stands thus:

  FOR THE PARLIAMENT:             THE SENATE USES:

  Postponement indefinite,        Postponement to a day beyond the session,
  Adjournment,                    Postponement to a day within the session,
  Lying on the table.           { Postponement indefinite,
                                { Lying on the table.

In their eighth rule, therefore, which declares that while the question
is before the Senate no motion shall be received, unless it be for the
previous question, or to postpone, commit, or amend the main question,
the term postponement must be understood according to their broad use of
it and not in the parliamentary sense. Their rule then establishes as
privileged questions, the previous questions, postponement, commitment
and amendment.

But it may be asked, Have these questions any privileges among
themselves? or are they so equal that the common principle of the “first
moved first put” takes place among them? This will need explanation.
Their competitions may be as follows:

  1. Previous question and postpone   } In the first, second and
                           commit     } third classes, and the
                           amend      } first member of the
                                        fourth class the rule
  2. Postpone and previous question   } “first moved first put”
                           commit     } takes place.
                           amend      }

  3. Commit and previous question     }
                         postpone     }
                         amend        }

  4. Amend and previous question      }
                         postpone     }
                         commit       }

In the first class, where the previous question is first moved, the
effect is peculiar; for it not only prevents the after motion to
postpone or commit from being put to question before it, but also from
being put after it; for if the previous question be decided
affirmatively, to wit, that the main question shall _now_ be put, it
would of course be against the decision to postpone or commit; and if it
be decided negatively, to wit, that the main question shall not now be
put, this puts the House out of possession of the main question, and
consequently there is nothing before them to postpone or commit. So that
neither voting for nor against the previous question will enable the
advocates for postponing or committing to get at their object. Whether
it may be amended shall be examined hereafter.

Second class. If postponement be decided affirmatively, the proposition
is removed from before the House, and consequently there is no ground
for the previous question, commitment, or amendment; but if decided
negatively (that it shall not be postponed), the main question may then
be suppressed by the previous question, or may be committed or amended.

The third class is subject to the same observations as the second.

The fourth class. Amendment of the main question first moved, and
afterwards the previous question, the question of amendment shall be
first put.

Amendment and postponement competing, postponement is first put, as the
equivalent proposition to adjourn the main question would be in
Parliament. The reason is, that the question for amendment is not
suppressed by postponing or adjourning the main question, but remains
before the House whenever the main question is resumed; and it might be
that the occasion for other urgent business might go by, and be lost by
length of debate on the amendment if the House had it not in their power
to postpone the whole subject.

Amendment and commitment. The question for committing though last moved,
shall be first put; because, in truth, it facilitates and befriends the
motion to amend. _Scobell_ is express: “On motion to amend a bill, any
one may notwithstanding move to commit it, and the question for
commitment shall be first put.” _Scob._, 46.

We have hitherto considered the case of two or more of the privileged
questions contending for privilege between themselves, when both are
moved on the original or main question; but now let us suppose one of
them to be moved not on the original primary question, but on the
secondary one, _e. g._

Suppose a motion to postpone, commit or amend the main question, and
that it be moved to suppress that motion by putting a previous question
on it. This is not allowed, because it would embarrass questions too
much to allow them to be piled on one another several stories high; and
the same result may be had in a more simple way, by deciding against the
postponement, commitment or amendment. 2 _Hats._, 81, 2, 3, 4.

Suppose a motion for the previous question, or commitment, or amendment
of the main question, and that it be then moved to postpone the motion
for the previous question, or for commitment or amendment of the main
question. 1. It would be absurd to postpone the previous question,
commitment or amendment alone, and thus separate the appendage from its
principal; yet it must be postponed separately from its original, if at
all, because the eighth rule of Senate says that “When a main question
is before the house, no motion shall be received but to commit, amend or
pre-question the original question,” which is the parliamentary doctrine
also; therefore, the motion to postpone the secondary motion for the
previous question, or for committing or amending, cannot be received. 2.
This is a piling of questions one on another; which, to avoid
embarrassment, is not allowed. 3. The same result may be had more simply
by voting against the previous question, commitment or amendment.

Suppose a commitment moved of a motion for the previous question, or to
postpone or amend. The first, second and third reasons before stated,
all hold good against this.

Suppose an amendment moved to a motion for the previous question.
Answer: the previous question cannot be amended. Parliamentary usage, as
well as the ninth rule of the Senate, has fixed its form to be, “Shall
the main question be now put?”--_i. e._, at this instant; and as the
present instant is but one, it can admit of no modification. To change
it to to-morrow, or any other moment, is without example and without
utility. But suppose a motion to amend a motion for postponement, as to
one day instead of another, or to a special instead of an indefinite
time. The useful character of amendment gives it a privilege of
attaching itself to a secondary and privileged motion: that is, we may
amend a postponement of a main question. So, we may amend a commitment
of a main question, as by adding, for example, “with instructions to
inquire,” etc. In like manner, if an amendment be moved to an amendment,
it is admitted; but it would not be admitted in another degree, to-wit:
to amend an amendment to an amendment of a main question. This would
lead to too much embarrassment. The line must be drawn somewhere, and
usage has drawn it after the amendment to the amendment. The same result
must be sought by deciding against the amendment to the amendment, and
then moving it again as it wished to be amended. In this form it becomes
only an amendment to an amendment.

[When motions are made for reference of the same subject to a select
committee and to a standing committee, the question on reference to the
standing committee shall be first put. _Rule 36._]

[In filling a blank with a sum, the largest sum shall be first put to
the question, by the thirteenth rule of the Senate,[42]] contrary to the
rule of Parliament, which privileges the smallest sum and longest time.
5 _Grey_, 179; 2 _Hats._, 8, 83; 3 _Hats._, 132, 133. And this is
considered to be not in the form of an amendment to the question, but as
alternative or successive originals. In all cases of time or number, we
must consider whether the larger comprehends the lesser, as in a
question to what day a postponement shall be, the number of a committee,
amount of a fine, term of an imprisonment, term of irredeemability of a
loan, or the _terminus in quem_ in any other case; then the question
must begin _a maximo_. Or whether the lesser includes the greater, as in
questions on the limitation of the rate of interest, on what day the
session shall be closed by adjournment, on what day the next shall
commence when an act shall commence, or the _terminus a quo_ in any
other case where the question must begin _a minimo_; the object being
not to begin at that extreme which, and more, being within every man’s
wish, no one could negative it, and yet, if he should vote in the
affirmative, every question for more would be precluded; but at that
extreme which would unite few, and then to advance or recede till you
get a number which will unite a bare majority. 3 _Grey_, 376, 384, 385.
“The fair question in this case is not that to which, and more, all will
agree, whether there shall be addition to the question.” _Grey_, 355.

Another exception to the rule of priority is when a motion has been made
to strike out or agree to a paragraph. Motions to amend it are to be put
to the question before a vote is taken on striking out or agreeing to
the whole paragraph.

But there are several questions which, being incidental to every one,
will take place of every one, privileged or not, to-wit: a question of
order arising out of any other question must be decided before that
question. 2 _Hats._, 88.

A matter of privilege arising out of any question, or from a quarrel
between two members or any other cause, supercedes the consideration of
the original question, and must be first disposed of. 2 _Hats._, 88.

Reading papers relative to the question before the House. This question
must be put before the principal one. 2 _Hats._, 88.

Leave asked to withdraw a motion. The rule of Parliament being that a
motion made and seconded is in the possession of the House, and cannot
be withdrawn without leave, the very terms of the rule imply that leave
may be given, and, consequently, may be asked and put to the question.


SECTION XXXIV.

THE PREVIOUS QUESTION.

When any question is before the House, any member may move a previous
question. “Whether that question (called the main question) shall now be
put?” If it pass in the affirmative, then the main question is to be put
immediately, and no man may speak anything further to it, either to add
or alter. _Memor. in Hakew._, 28; 4 _Grey_, 27.

The previous question being moved and seconded, the question from the
chair shall be, “Shall the main question be now put?” and if the nays
prevail, the main question shall not then be put.

This kind of question is understood by Mr. Hatsell to have been
introduced in 1604. 1 _Hats._, 80. Sir Henry Vane introduced it. _2
Grey_, 113, 114; 3 _Grey_, 384. When the question was put in this form,
“Shall the main question be put?” a determination in the negative
suppressed the main question during the session; but since the words,
“now put” are used, they exclude it for the present only; formerly,
indeed, only till the present debate was over (4 _Grey_, 43), but now
for that day and no longer. 2 _Grey_, 113, 114.

Before the question “Whether the main question shall now be put?” any
person might formerly have spoken to the main question, because
otherwise he would be precluded from speaking to it at all. _Mem. in
Hakew._, 28.

The proper occasion for the previous question, is when a question is
brought forward of a delicate nature as to high personages, etc., or the
discussion of which may call forth observations which might be of
injurious consequences. Then the previous question is proposed; and in
the modern usage, the discussion of the main question is suspended, and
the debate confined to the previous question. The use of it has been
extended abusively to other cases; but in these it has been an
embarrassing procedure; its uses would be as well answered by other more
simple parliamentary forms, and therefore it should not be favored, but
restricted within as narrow limits as possible.

Whether a main question may be amended after the previous question on it
has been moved and seconded? 2 _Hats._, 88, says, if the previous
question has been moved and seconded, and also proposed from the chair
(by which he means stated by the Speaker for debate), it has been
doubted whether an amendment can be admitted to the main question. He
thinks it may, after the previous question is moved and seconded; but
not after it has been proposed from the chair. In this case he thinks
the friends to the amendment must vote that the main question be not now
put; and then move their amended question, which being made new by the
amendment, is no longer the same which has just been suppressed, and
therefore may be proposed as a new one. But this proceeding certainly
endangers the main question, by dividing its friends, some of whom may
choose it unamended, rather than lose it altogether; while others of
them may vote, as Hatsell advises, that the main question be not now put
with a view to move it again in an amended form. The enemies of the main
question, by this manœuvre to the previous question, get the enemies to
the amendment added to them on the first vote, and throw the friends of
the main question under the embarrassment of rallying again as they can.
To support his opinion, too, he makes the deciding circumstances,
whether an amendment may or may not be made, to be, that the previous
question has been proposed from the Chair. But, as the rule is that the
House is in possession of a question as soon as it is moved and
seconded, it cannot be more than possessed of it by its being also
proposed from the Chair. It maybe said, indeed, that the object of the
previous question being to get rid of a question, which it is not
expedient should be discussed, this object may be defeated by moving to
amend, and, in the discussion of that motion, involving the subject of
the main question. But so may the object of the previous question be
defeated, by moving the amended question as Mr. Hatsell proposes after
the decision against putting the original question. He acknowledges,
too, that the practice has been to admit previous amendments, and only
cites a few late instances to the contrary. On the whole, I should think
it best to decide it ab inconvenienti, to wit: which is most
inconvenient, to put it in the power of one side of the House to defeat
a proposition by hastily moving the previous question, and thus forcing
the main question to be put unamended; or to put it in the power of the
other side to force on, incidentally at least, a discussion which would
be better avoided? Perhaps the last is the least inconvenience; inasmuch
as the Speaker, by confining the discussion rigorously to the amendment
only, may prevent their going into the main question, and inasmuch also
as so great a proportion of the cases in which the previous question is
called for, are fair and proper subjects for public discussion, and
ought not to be obstructed by a formality introduced for questions of a
peculiar character.


SECTION XXXV.

AMENDMENTS.

On an amendment being moved, a member who has spoken to the main
question may speak again to the amendment. _Scob._, 23.

If an amendment be proposed inconsistent with one already agreed to, it
is a fit ground for its rejection by the House, but not within the
competence of the Speaker to suppress as if it were against order; for
were he permitted to draw questions of consistence within the vortex of
order, he might usurp a negative on important modifications, and
suppress, instead of subserving the legislative will.

Amendments may be made so as totally to alter the nature of the
proposition; and it is a way of getting rid of a proposition, by making
it bear a sense different from what it was intended by the movers, so
that they vote against it themselves. 2 _Hats._, 79, 4, 82, 84. A new
bill may be engrafted by way of amendment, on the words, “Be it
enacted,” etc. 1 _Grey_, 190, 192.

If it be proposed to amend by leaving out certain words, it may be
moved, as an amendment to this amendment, to leave out part of the words
of the amendment, which is equivalent to leaving them in the bill _2
Hats._, 80, 9. The parliamentary question is, always, whether the words
shall stand part of the bill.

When it is proposed to amend by inserting a paragraph, or part of one,
the friends of the paragraph may make it as perfect as they can by
amendments before the question is put for inserting it. If it be
received, it cannot be amended afterwards, in the same stage, because
the House has, on a vote, agreed to it in that form. In like manner, if
it is proposed to amend by striking out a paragraph, the friends of the
paragraph are first to make it as perfect as they can by amendments,
before the question is put for striking it out. If on the question it be
retained, it cannot be amended afterwards, because a vote against
striking out is equivalent to a vote agreeing to it in that form.

When it is moved to amend by striking out certain words and inserting
others, the manner of stating the question is first to read the whole
passage to be amended as it stands at present, then the words proposed
to be struck out, next those to be inserted, and lastly the whole
passage as it will be when amended. And the question, if desired, is
then to be divided, and put first on striking out. If carried, it is
next on inserting the words proposed. If that be lost, it may be moved
to insert others. 2 _Hats._, 80, 7.

A motion is made to amend by striking out certain words and inserting
others in their place, which is negatived. Then it is moved to strike
out the same words, and to insert others, of a tenor entirely different
from those first proposed. It is negatived. Then it is moved to strike
out the same words and insert nothing, which is agreed to. All this is
admissible, because to strike out and insert A, is one proposition. To
strike out and insert B, is a different proposition. And to strike out
and insert nothing is still different. And the rejection of one
proposition does not preclude the offering a different one. Nor would it
change the case were the first motion divided by putting the question
first on striking out, and that negatived; for, as putting the whole
motion to the question at once would not have precluded, the putting the
half of it cannot do it.[43]

But if it had been carried affirmatively to strike out the words and to
insert A, it could not afterwards be permitted to strike out A and
insert B. The mover of B should have notified, while the insertion of A
was under debate, that he would move to insert B; in which case those
who preferred it would join in rejecting A.

After A is inserted, however, it may be moved to strike out a portion of
the original paragraph, comprehending A, provided the coherence to be
struck out be so substantial as to make this effectively a different
proposition; for then it is resolved into the common case of striking
out a paragraph after amending it. Nor does anything forbid a new
insertion, instead of A and its coherence.

In Senate, January 25, 1798, a motion to postpone until the second
Tuesday in February some amendments proposed to the Constitution; the
words “until the second Tuesday in February” were struck out by way of
amendment. Then it was moved to add, “until the first day of June.”
Objected that it was not in order, as the question should be first put
on the longest time; therefore, after a shorter time decided against, a
longer cannot be put to question. It was answered that this rule takes
place only in filling blanks for time. But when a specific time stands
part of motion, that may be struck out as well as any other part of a
motion; and when struck out, a motion may be received to insert any
other. In fact, it is not until they are struck out, and a blank for the
time thereby produced, that the rule can begin to operate, by receiving
all the propositions for different times, and putting the question
successively on the longest. Otherwise it would be in the power of the
mover, by inserting originally a short time, to preclude the possibility
of a longer, for till the short time is struck out, you cannot insert a
longer; and if, after it is struck out, you cannot do it, then it cannot
be done at all. Suppose the first motion had been made to amend by
striking out “the second Tuesday in February,” and inserting instead
thereof “the first of June;” it would have been regular, then, to divide
the question, by proposing the first question to strike out and then
that to insert. Now this is precisely the effect of the present
proceeding; only, instead of one motion and two questions, there are two
motions and two questions to effect it--the motion being divided as well
as the question.

When the matter contained in two bills might better be put into one, the
manner is to reject the one, and incorporate its matter into another
bill by way of amendment. So if the matter of one bill would be better
distributed into two, any part may be struck out by way of amendment,
and put into a new bill. If a section is to be transposed, a question
must be put on striking it out where it stands, and another for
inserting it in the place desired.

A bill passed by the one house with blanks. These may be filled up by
the other by way of amendments, returned to the first as such, and
passed. 3 _Hats._, 83.

The number prefixed to the section of a bill, being merely a marginal
indication, and no part of the text of the bill, the clerk regulates
that--the House or committee is only to amend the text.


SECTION XXXVI.

DIVISION OF THE QUESTION.

If a question contain more parts than one, it may be divided into two or
more questions. _Mem. in Hakew._, 39. But not as the right of an
individual member, but with the consent of the House. For who is to
decide whether a question is complicated or not?--where it is
complicated?--into how many propositions it may be divided? The fact is,
that the only mode of separating a complicated question is by moving
amendments to it; and these must be decided by the House, on a question,
unless the House orders it to be divided; as, on the question, December
2, 1640, making void the election of the knights for Worcester, on a
motion it was resolved to make two questions of it, to-wit: one on each
knight. 2 _Hats._, 85, 86. So, wherever there are several names in
question, they may be divided and put one by one. 9 _Grey_, 444. So,
1729, April 17, on an objection that a question was complicated, it was
separated by amendment. 2 _Hats._, 79.

The soundness of these observations will be evident from the
embarrassments produced by the 12th rule of the Senate, which says, “If
the question in debate contain several points, any member may have the
same divided.”

1798, May 30, the alien bill in quasi-committee. To a section and
proviso in the original had been added two new provisos by way of
amendment. On a motion to strike out the section as amended, the
question was desired to be divided. To do this it must be put first on
striking out either the former proviso or some distinct member of the
section. But when nothing remains but the last member or the section and
the proviso, they cannot be divided so as to put the last member to
question by itself; for the provisos might then be left standing alone
as exceptions to a rule when the rule is taken away; or the new provisos
might be left to a second question, after having been decided on once
before at the same reading, which is contrary to rule. But the question
must be on striking out the last member of the section as amended. This
sweeps away the exceptions with the rule, and relieves from
inconsistence. A question to be divisible, must comprehend points so
distinct and entire that one of them being taken away the other may
stand entire. But a proviso or exception without an enacting clause does
not contain an entire point or proposition.

May 31. The same bill being before the Senate. There was a proviso that
the bill should not extend, 1, To any foreign minister; nor, 2, To any
person to whom the President should give a passport; nor, 3, To any
alien merchant conforming himself to such regulations as the President
shall prescribe; and a division of the question into its simplest
elements was called for. It was divided into four parts, the fourth
taking in the words, “conforming himself,” etc. It was objected that the
words, “any alien merchant,” could not be separated from their modifying
words, “conforming,” etc., because these words if left by themselves
contain no substantive idea--will make no sense. But admitting that the
divisions of a paragraph into separate questions must be so made that
each part may stand by itself, yet the House having, on the question,
retained the two first divisions, the words, “any alien merchant,” may
be struck out, and their modifying words will then attach themselves to
the preceding description of persons, and become a modification of that
description.

When a question is divided, after the question on the first member, the
second is open to debate and amendment; because it is a known rule that
a person may rise and speak at any time before the question has been
completely decided, by putting the negative as well as the affirmative
side. But the question is not completely put when the vote has been
taken on the first member only. One-half of the question, both
affirmative and negative, remains still to be put. See _Execut. Jour.,
June 25, 1795_. The same decision by President Adams.


SECTION XXXVII.

CO-EXISTING QUESTIONS.

It may be asked whether the House can be in possession of two motions or
propositions at the same time, so that one of them being decided, the
other goes to question without being moved anew? The answer must be
special. When a question is interrupted by a vote of adjournment, it is
thereby removed from before the House, and does not stand ipso facto
before them at their next meeting, but must come forward in the usual
way. So, when it is interrupted by the order of the day. Such other
privileged questions also as dispose of the main question (_e. g._ the
previous question, postponement, or commitment), remove it from before
the House. But it is only suspended by a motion to amend, to withdraw,
to read papers, or by a question of order or privilege, and stands again
before the House when these are decided. None but the class of
privileged questions can be brought forward while there is another
question before the House, the rule being that when a motion has been
made and seconded, no other can be received, except it be a privileged
one.


SECTION XXXVIII.

EQUIVALENT.

If, on a question for rejection, a bill be retained, it passes of course
to its next reading. _Hakew._, 141; _Scob._, 42. And a question for a
second reading determined negatively, is a rejection without further
question. 4 _Grey_, 149. And see _Elsynge’s Mem._, 42, in what cases
questions are to be taken for rejection.

Where questions are perfectly equivalent, so that the negative of the
one amounts to the affirmative of the other, and leaves no other
alternative, the decision of the one concludes necessarily the other. _4
Grey_, 157. Thus the negative of striking out amounts to the affirmative
of agreeing; and therefore to put a question on agreeing after that on
striking out, would be to put the same question in effect twice over.
Not so in questions of amendments between the two Houses. A motion to
recede being negatived, does not amount to a positive vote to insist,
because there is another alternative, to wit: to adhere.

A bill originating in one House is passed by the other with an
amendment. A motion in the originating House to agree to the amendment
is negatived. Does there result from this a vote of disagreement, or
must the question on disagreement be expressly voted? The questions
respecting amendments from another house are--1st, to agree; 2d, to
disagree; 3d, recede; 4th, insist; 5th, adhere.

  1st. To agree.   } Either of these concludes the other
  2d. To disagree. } necessarily, for the positive of either is
                     exactly the equivalent of the negative of
                     the other, and no other alternative remains.
                     On either motion amendments to
                     the amendments may be proposed: _e. g._,
                     if it be moved to disagree, those who are
                     for the amendment have a right to propose
                     amendments, and to make it as perfect
                     as they can, before the question of
                     disagreeing is put.
  3d.  To recede. } You may then either insist or adhere.
  4th. To insist. } You may then either recede or adhere.
  5th. To adhere. } You may then either recede or insist.

                    Consequently the negative of these is not
                    equivalent to a positive vote the other
                    way. It does not raise so necessary an
                    implication as may authorize the Secretary
                    by inference to enter another vote; for
                    two alternatives still remain, either of
                    which may be adopted by the House.


SECTION XXXIX.

THE QUESTION.

The question is to be first put on the affirmative, and then on the
negative side.

After the Speaker has put the affirmative part of the question, any
member who has not spoken before to the question may rise and speak
before the negative be put; because it is no full question till the
negative part be put. _Scob._, 23; 2 _Hats._, 73.

But in small matters, and which are, of course, such as receiving
petitions, reports, withdrawing motions, reading papers, etc., the
Speaker most commonly supposes the consent of the House where no
objection is expressed, and does not give them the trouble of putting
the question formally. _Scob._, 22; 2 _Hats._, 87; 5 _Grey_, 129; _9
Grey_, 301.


SECTION XL.

BILLS--THIRD READING.

To prevent bills from being passed by surprise, the House by a standing
order, directs that they shall not be put on their passage before a
fixed hour, naming one at which the House is commonly full. _Hakew._,
153.

[The usage of the Senate is, not to put bills on their passage till
noon.]

A bill reported and passed to the third reading cannot on that day be
read the third time and passed; because this would be to pass on two
readings in the same day.

At the third reading the clerk reads the bill and delivers it to the
Speaker, who states the title, that it is the third time of reading the
bill, and that the question will be whether it shall pass? Formerly, the
Speaker, or those who prepared a bill, prepared also a breviate or
summary statement of its contents, which the Speaker read when he
declared the state of the bill, at the several readings. Sometimes,
however, he read the bill itself, especially on its passage. _Hakew._,
136, 137, 153; Coke, 22, 115. Latterly, instead of this, he, at the
third reading, states the whole contents of the bill, verbatim, only,
instead, of reading the formal parts “Be it enacted,” etc., he states
that “preamble recites so and so--the first section enacts that, etc.;
the second section enacts,” etc.

[But in the Senate of the United States both of these formalities are
dispensed with; the breviate presenting but an imperfect view of the
bill, and being capable of being made to present a false one; and the
full statement being a useless waste of time, immediately after a full
reading by the clerk, and especially as every member has a printed copy
in his hand.]

A bill on the third reading is not to be committed for the matter or
body thereof; but to receive some particular clause or proviso, it has
been sometimes suffered, but as a thing very unusual. _Hakew._, 126.
Thus, _27 El._, 1584, a bill was committed on the third reading, having
been formally committed on the second, but it is declared not usual.
_D’Ewes_, 337, _col._ 2; 414, _col._ 2.

When an essential provision has been omitted, rather than erase the bill
and render it suspicious, they add a clause on a separate paper,
engrossed and called a rider, which is read and put to the question
three times. _Elsynge’s Memorials_, 59; 6 _Grey_, 335; 1 _Blackst._,
183. For examples of riders, see 3 _Hats._, 121, 122, 124, 126. Every
one is at liberty to bring in a rider without asking leave. _10 Grey_,
52.

It is laid down as a general rule, that amendments proposed at the
second reading shall be twice read, and those proposed at the third
reading thrice read; as also all amendments from the other House.
_Town._, _col._ 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.

It is with great and almost invincible reluctance that amendments are
admitted at this reading, which occasion erasures or interlineations.
Sometimes a proviso has been cut off from a bill; sometimes erased. _9
Grey_, 513.

This is the proper stage for filling up blanks; for if filled up before,
and now altered by erasure, it would be peculiarly unsafe.

At this reading the bill is debated afresh, and for the most part is
more spoken to at this time than on any of the former readings.
_Hakew._, 153.

The debate on the question whether it should be read a third time has
discovered to its friends and opponents the arguments on which each side
relies, and which of these appear to have influence with the House; they
have had time to meet them with new arguments, and to put their old
ones into new shapes. The former vote has tried the strength of the
former opinion, and furnished grounds to estimate the issue; and the
question now offered for its passage is the last occasion which is ever
to be offered for carrying or rejecting it.

When the debate is ended, the Speaker, holding the bill in his hand,
puts the question for its passage, by saying, “Gentlemen, all of you who
are of opinion that this bill shall pass, say aye;” and after the answer
of the ayes, “All those of the contrary opinion, say no.” _Hakew._, 154.

After the bill is passed, there can be no further alteration of it in
any point. _Hakew._, 159.


SECTION XLI.

DIVISION OF THE HOUSE.

The affirmative and negative of the question having been both put and
answered, the Speaker declares whether the yeas or nays have it by the
sound, if he be himself satisfied, and it stands as the judgment of the
House. But if he be not himself satisfied which voice is the greater, or
if before any other member comes into the House, or before any new
motion is made (for it is too late after that), any member shall rise
and declare himself dissatisfied with the Speaker’s decision, then the
Speaker is to divide the House. _Scob._, 24; 2 _Hats._, 140.

When the House of Commons is divided, the one party goes forth, and the
other remains in the House. This has made it important which go forth
and which remain; because the latter gain all the indolent, the
indifferent, and inattentive. Their general rule therefore, is, that
those who give their vote for the preservation of the orders of the
House, shall stay in; and those who are for introducing any new matter
or alteration, or proceeding contrary to the established course, are to
go out. But this rule is subject to many exceptions and modifications.
2 _Hats._, 134; 1 _Rush._, _p._ 3, _fol._ 92; _Scob._, 43, 52; _Co._,
12, 116; _D’Ewes_, 505, _col._ 1; _Mem. in Hakew._, 25, 29, as will
appear by the following statement of who go forth.

    If after 2 o’clock                                  Noes.

  Adjournment. Till the next sitting day, if before
      4 o’clock                                         Ayes.

    If after 4 o’clock                                  Noes.

    Over a sitting day (unless a previous resolution)   Ayes.

    Over the 30th of January                            Noes.

  For sitting on Sunday, or any other day not being a
        sitting day                                     Ayes.

The one party being gone forth, the Speaker names two tellers from the
affirmative and two from the negative side, who first count those
sitting in the House and report the number to the Speaker. Then they
place themselves within the door, two on each side, and count those who
went forth as they come in, and report the number to the Speaker. _Mem.
in Hakew._, 26.

A mistake in the report of the tellers may be rectified after the report
made. 2 _Hats._, 145, note.

[But in both Houses of Congress all these intricacies are avoided. The
ayes first rise, and are counted standing in their places by the
President or Speaker. Then they sit, and the noes rise and are counted
in like manner.]

[In Senate, if they are equally divided, the Vice-President announces
his opinion, which decides.]

[The Constitution, however, has directed that “the yeas and nays of the
members of either House, on any question shall, at the desire of
one-fifth of those present, be entered on the journal.” And again: that
in all cases of reconsidering a bill disapproved by the President, and
returned with his objections, “the votes of both Houses shall be
determined by yeas and nays, and the names of the persons voting for and
against the bill shall be entered on the journals of each House
respectively.”]

[By the 16th and 17th rules of the Senate, when the yeas and nays shall
be called for by one-fifth of the members present, each member called
upon shall, unless for special reasons he be excused by the Senate,
declare openly, and without debate, his assent or dissent to the
question. In taking the yeas and nays, and upon the call of the House,
the names of the members shall be taken alphabetically.]

[When the yeas and nays shall be taken upon any question in pursuance of
the above rule, no member shall be permitted, under any circumstances
whatever, to vote after the decision is announced from the chair.]

[When it is proposed to take the vote by yeas and nays, the President or
Speaker stales that “the question is whether, _e. g._, the bill shall
pass--that it is proposed that the yeas and nays shall be entered on the
journal. Those, therefore, who desire it, will rise.” If he finds and
declares that one-fifth have risen, he then states that “those who are
of the opinion that the bill shall pass, are to answer in the
affirmative; those of the contrary opinion in the negative.” The clerk
then calls over the names alphabetically, notes the yea or nay of each,
and gives the list to the President or Speaker, who declares the result.
In the Senate, if there be an equal division, the Secretary calls on the
Vice-President and notes his affirmative or negative, which becomes the
decision of the House.]

In the House of Commons, every member must give his vote the one way or
the other, (_Scob._, 24.,) as it is not permitted to any one to withdraw
who is in the House when the question is put, nor is any one to be told
in the division who was not in when the question was put. 2 _Hats._,
140.

This last position is always true when the vote is by yeas and nays;
where the negative as well as affirmative of the question is stated by
the President at the same time, and the vote of both sides begins and
proceeds _pari passu_. It is true also when the question is put in the
usual way, if the negative has also been put; but if it has not, the
member entering, or any other member, may speak, and even propose
amendments, by which the debate may be opened again, and the question be
greatly deferred. And as some who have answered aye may have been
changed by the new arguments, the affirmative must be put over again.
If, then, the member entering may, by speaking a few words, occasion a
repetition of a question, it would be useless to deny it on his simple
call for it.

While the House is telling, no member may speak or move out of his
place, for if any mistake be suspected it must be told again. _Mem. in
Hakew._, 26; 2 _Hats._, 143.

If any difficulty arises in point of order during the division, the
Speaker is to decide peremptorily, subject to the future censure of the
House if irregular. He sometimes permits old experienced members to
assist him with their advice which they do sitting in their seats,
covered, to avoid the appearance of debate; but this can only be with
the Speaker’s leave, else the division might last several hours. _2
Hats._, 143.

The voice of the majority decides; for the _lex majoris partis_ is the
law of all councils, elections, etc., where not otherwise expressly
provided. _Hakew._, 93. But if the House be equally divided, “_semper
presumatur pro negante_;” that is, the former law is not to be changed
but by a majority. _Towns._, _col._ 134.

[But in the Senate of the United States, the Vice-President decides when
the House is divided. _Const., U. S._, I, 3.]

When from counting the House on a division, it appears that there is not
a quorum, the matter continues exactly in the State in which it was
before the division, and must be resumed at that point on any future
day. 2 _Hats._, 126.

1606, May 1, on a question whether a member having said yea may
afterwards sit and change his opinion, a precedent was remembered by the
Speaker, of Mr. Morris, attorney of the wards, in _39 Elis._, who in
like case changed his opinion. _Mem. Hakew._, 27.


SECTION XLII.

TITLES.

After the bill has passed, and not before, the title may be amended, and
is to be fixed by a question; and the bill is then sent to the other
house.


SECTION XLIII.

RECONSIDERATION.

[When a question has been once made and carried in the affirmative, or
negative, it shall be in order for any member of the majority to move
for the reconsideration thereof; but no motion for the reconsideration
of any vote shall be in order after a bill, resolution, message, report,
amendment, or motion upon which the vote was taken shall have gone out
of the possession of the Senate announcing their decision; nor shall any
motion for reconsideration be in order unless made on the same day on
which the vote was taken, or within the two next days of the actual
session of the Senate thereafter. _Rule 20._]

[1798, January. A bill on its second reading being amended and on the
question whether it shall be read a third time negatived, was restored
by a decision to reconsider that question. Here the votes of negative
and reconsideration, like positive and negative quantities in an
equation, destroy one another, and are as if they were expunged from the
journal. Consequently the bill is open for amendment, just so far as it
was the moment preceding the question for the third reading; that is to
say, all parts of the bill are open for amendment except those on which
votes have been already taken in its present stage. So, also, it may be
recommitted.]

[[45]The rule permitting a reconsideration of a question affixing to it
no limitation of time or circumstance, it may be asked whether there is
no limitation? If, after the vote, the paper on which it is passed has
been parted with, there can be no reconsideration; as if a vote has been
for the passage of a bill, and the bill has been sent to the other
House. But where the paper remains, as on a bill rejected, when, or
under what circumstances, does it cease to be susceptible of
reconsideration? This remains to be settled; unless, a sense that the
right of reconsideration is a right to waste the time of the House in
repeated agitations of the same question, so that it shall never know
when a question is done with, should induce them to reform this
anomalous proceeding.]

In Parliament, a question once carried cannot be questioned again at the
same session, but must stand as the judgment of the House. _Towns._
_col._, 67.; _Mem. in Hakew._, 33. And a bill once rejected, another of
the same substance cannot be brought in again the same session.
_Hakew._, 158; 6 _Grey_, 392. But this does not extend to prevent
putting the same question in different stages of a bill; because every
stage of a bill submits the whole and every part of it to the opinion of
the House, as open for amendment, either by insertion or omission,
though the same amendment has been accepted or rejected in a former
stage. So in reports of committees, _e. g._, report of an address, the
same question is before the House, and open for free discussion.
_Towns._, _col._ 26; 2 _Hats._, 98, 100, 101. So orders of the House, or
instructions to committee, may be discharged. So a bill, begun in one
house, and sent to the other, and there rejected, may be renewed again
in that other, passed and sent back. _Ib._, 92; 3 _Hats._, 161. Or if,
instead of being rejected, they read it once and lay it aside, or amend
it, and put it off a month, they may order in another to the same
effect, with the same or a different title. _Hakew._, 97, 98.

Divers expedients are used to correct the effects of this rule; as by
passing an explanatory act, if anything has been omitted or ill
expressed (3 _Hats._, 278), or an act to enforce, and make more
effectual an act, etc., or to rectify mistakes in act, etc., or a
committee on one bill may be instructed to receive a clause to rectify
the mistakes of another. Thus, June 24, 1685, a clause was inserted in a
bill for rectifying a mistake committed by a clerk in engrossing a bill
of supply. 2 _Hats._, 194, 6. Or the session may be closed for one, two,
three, or more days, and a new one commenced. But then all matters
depending must be finished, or they fall, and are to begin de novo. _3
Hats._, 94, 98. Or a part of the subject may be taken up by another
bill, or taken up in a different way. 6 _Grey_, 304, 316.

And in cases of the last magnitude, this rule has not been so strictly
and verbally observed as to stop indispensable proceedings altogether,
2 _Hats._, 92, 98. Thus when the address on the preliminaries of peace
in 1782 had been lost by a majority of one, on account of the importance
of the question, and smallness of the majority, the same question in
substance, though with some words not in the first, and which might
change the opinion of some members, was brought on again and carried, as
the motives for it were thought to outweigh the objection of form. _2
Hats._, 99, 100.

A second bill may be passed to continue an act of the same session, or
to enlarge the time limited for its execution. 2 _Hats._, 95, 98. This
is not in contradiction to the first act.


SECTION XLIV.

BILLS SENT TO THE OTHER HOUSE.

[All bills passed in the Senate shall, before they are sent to the House
of Representatives, be examined by a committee, consisting of three
members, whose duty shall be to examine all bills, amendments,
resolutions, or motions, before they go out of the possession of the
Senate, and to make report that they are correctly engrossed; which
report shall be entered on the journal. _Rule 33._]

A bill from the other House is sometimes ordered to lie on the table. _2
Hats._, 97.

When bills, passed in one House and sent to the other, are grounded on
special facts requiring proof, it is usual, either by message or at a
conference, to ask the grounds and evidence; and this evidence, whether
arising out of papers, or from the examination of witnesses, is
immediately communicated. 3 _Hats._, 48.


SECTION XLV.

AMENDMENTS BETWEEN THE HOUSES.

When either house, _e. g._, the House of Commons, sends a bill to the
other, the other may pass it with amendments. The regular progression in
this case is, that the Commons disagree to the amendment; the Lords
insist on it; the Commons insist on their disagreement; the Lords adhere
to their amendment; the Commons adhere to their disagreement. The term
of insisting may be repeated as often as they choose to keep the
question open. But the first adherence by either renders it necessary
for the other to recede or adhere also; when the matter is usually
suffered to fall. _10 Grey_, 148. Latterly, however, there are instances
of their having gone to a second adherence. There must be an absolute
conclusion of the subject somewhere, or otherwise transactions between
the houses would become endless. 3 _Hats._, 268, 270. The term of
insisting, we are told by Sir John Trevor, was then (1679) newly
introduced into parliamentary usage by the Lords. 7 _Grey_, 94. It was
certainly a happy innovation, as it multiplies the opportunities of
trying modifications which may bring the houses to concurrence. Either
house, however, is free to pass over the term of insisting, and to
adhere in the first instance (_10 Grey_, 146); but it is not respectful
to the other. In the ordinary parliamentary course, there are two free
conferences, at least before an adherence. _10 Grey_, 147.

Either house may recede from its amendment and agree to the bill; or
recede from their disagreement to the amendment, and agree to the same
absolutely, or with an amendment; for here the disagreement and receding
destroy one another, and the subject stands as before the disagreement.
_Elsynge_, 23, 27; 9 _Grey_, 476.

But the House cannot recede from, or insist on its own amendment, with
an amendment; for the same reason that it cannot send to the other house
an amendment to its own act after it has passed the act. They may
modify an amendment from the other house by ingrafting an amendment on
it, because they have never assented to it; but they cannot amend their
own amendment, because they have, on the question passed it in that
form. 9 _Grey_, 363; _10 Grey_, 240. In the Senate, March 29, 1798. Nor
where one house has adhered to their amendment, and the other agrees
with an amendment, can the first house depart from the form which they
have fixed by an adherence.

In the case of a money bill, the Lords’ proposed amendments become, by
delay, confessedly necessary. The Commons, however, refused them, as
infringing on their privileges as to money bills; but they offered
themselves to add to the bill a proviso to the same effect, which had no
coherence with the Lords’ amendments; and urged that it was an expedient
warranted by precedent, and not unparliamentary in a case become
impracticable, and irremediable in any other way. 3 _Hats._, 256, 266,
270, 271. But the Lords refused, and the bill was lost. 1 _Chand._, 288.
A like case, 1 _Chand._, 311. So the Commons resolved that it was
unparliamentary to strike out, at a conference, anything in a bill which
had been agreed and passed by both Houses. 6 _Grey_, 274; 1 _Chand._,
312.

A motion to amend an amendment from the other House takes precedence of
a motion to agree or disagree.

A bill originating in one House is passed by the other with an
amendment.

The originating House agrees to their amendment with an amendment. The
other may agree to their amendment with an amendment, that being only in
the 2d and not the 3d degree; for, as to the amending House, the first
amendment with which they passed the bill is a part of its text; it is
the only text they have agreed to. The amendment to that text by the
originating House, therefore, is only in the 1st degree, and the
amendment to that again by the amending House is only in the 2d, to wit:
an amendment to an amendment, and so admissible. Just so, when, on a
bill from the originating House, the other, at its second reading makes
an amendment; on the third reading this amendment is become the text of
the bill, and if an amendment to it be moved, an amendment to that
amendment may also be moved, as being only in the 2d degree.


SECTION XLVI.

CONFERENCES.

It is on the occasion of amendments between the Houses that conferences
are usually asked; but they may be asked in all cases of difference of
opinion between the two Houses on matters depending between them. The
request of a conference, however, must always be with the House which is
possessed of the papers. 3 _Hats._, 31; 1 _Grey_, 425.

Conferences may be either simple or free. At a conference simply,
written reasons are prepared by the House asking it, and they are read
and delivered, without debate, to the managers of the other House at the
conference; but are not then to be answered. 4 _Grey_, 144. The other
House, then, if satisfied, vote the reason satisfactory, or say nothing;
if not satisfied, they resolve them not satisfactory, and ask a
conference on the subject of the last conference, where they read and
deliver, in like manner, written answers to those reasons. 3 _Grey_,
183. They are meant chiefly to record the jurisdiction of each House to
the nation at large, and to posterity, and in proof that the miscarriage
of a necessary measure is not imputable to them. 3 _Grey_, 255. At free
conferences the managers discuss, viva voce and freely, and interchange
propositions for such modifications as may be made in a parliamentary
way, and may bring the sense of the two Houses together. And each party
reports in writing to their respective Houses the substance of what is
said on both sides, and it is entered in their journals. 9 _Grey_, 220;
3 _Hats._, 280. This report cannot be amended or altered, as that of a
committee may be. _Journal of Senate, May 24, 1796._

A conference may be asked, before the House asking it has come to a
resolution of disagreement, insisting or adhering. 3 _Hats._, 269, 341.
In which case the papers are not left with the other conferees, but are
brought back to be the foundation of the vote to be given. And this is
the most reasonable and respectful proceeding; for, as was urged by the
Lords on a particular occasion, “It is held vain, and below the wisdom
of Parliament, to reason or argue against fixed resolutions, and upon
terms of impossibility to persuade.” 3 _Hats._, 226. So the Commons say,
“An adherence is never delivered at a free conference, which implies
debate.” _10 Grey_, 137. And on another occasion the Lords made it an
objection that the Commons had asked a free conference after they had
made resolutions of adhering. It was then affirmed, however, on the part
of the Commons, that nothing was more parliamentary than to proceed with
free conferences after adhering (3 _Hats._, 269), and we do in fact see
inferences of conferences, or of free conference, asked after the
resolution of disagreeing (3 _Hats._, 251, 253, 260, 286, 291, 316,
349); of insisting (_Ib._ 280, 296, 299, 319, 322, 355); of adhering
(269, 270, 283, 300); and even of a second or final adherence; _3
Hats._, 270. And in all cases of conference asked after a vote of
disagreement, etc., the conferees of the House asking it are to leave
the papers with the conferees of the other; and in one case where they
refused to receive them, they were left on the table in the conference
chamber. _Ib._, 317, 323, 354; _10 Grey_, 146.

After a free conference, the usage is to proceed with free conferences,
and not return again to a conference. 3 _Hats._, 270; 9 _Grey_, 229.

After a conference denied, a free conference may be asked. 1 _Grey_, 45.

When a conference is asked, the subject of it must be expressed, or the
conference not agreed to. _Ord. H. Com._, 89; 1 _Grey_, 425; 7 _Grey_,
31. They are sometimes asked to inquire concerning an offence or default
of a member of the other House. 6 _Grey_, 181; 1 _Chand._, 304. Or the
failure of the other House to present to the King a bill passed by both
Houses. 8 _Grey_, 302. Or on information received, and relating to the
safety of the nation. _10 Grey_, 177. Or when the methods of Parliament
are thought by the one House to have been departed from by the other, a
conference is asked to come to a right understanding thereon. _10 Grey_,
148. So when an unparliamentary message has been sent, instead of
answering it, they ask a conference. 3 _Grey_, 155. Formerly an address
or article of impeachment, or a bill with amendments, or a vote of the
House, or concurrence in a vote, or a message from the King, were
sometimes communicated by way of conference. 6 _Grey_, 128, 300, 387; _7
Grey_, 80; 8 _Grey_, 210, 255; 1 _Torbuck’s Deb._, 278; _10 Grey_, 293;
1 _Chandler_, 49, 287. But this is not the modern practice. 8 _Grey_,
255.

A conference has been asked after the first reading of the bill. _1
Grey_, 194. This is a singular instance.

Messages between the Houses are to be sent only while both Houses are
sitting. 3 _Hats._, 15. They are received during debate without
adjourning the debate. 3 _Hats._, 22.

[In Senate the messengers are introduced in any state of business,
except, 1. While a question is putting. 2. While the yeas and nays are
calling. 3. While the ballots are counting. _Rule 47._ The first case is
short; the second and third are cases where any interruption might
occasion errors difficult to be corrected. So arranged June 15, 1788.]

In the House of Representatives, as in Parliament, if the House be in
committee when a messenger attends, the Speaker takes the chair to
receive the message, and then quits it to return into committee, without
any question or interruption. 4 _Grey_, 226.

Messengers are not saluted by the members, but by the Speaker of the
House. 2 _Grey_, 253, 274.

If messengers commit an error in delivering their message, they may be
admitted or called in to correct their message. 4 _Grey_, 41.
Accordingly, March 13, 1800, the Senate having made two amendments to a
bill from the House of Representatives, their Secretary, by mistake,
delivered one only, which being inadmissible by itself, that house
disagreed, and notified the Senate of their disagreement. This produced
a discovery of the mistake. The Secretary was sent to the House to
correct his mistake, the correction was received, and the two amendments
acted on de novo.

As soon as the messenger, who has brought bills from the other House,
has retired, the Speaker holds the bills in his hand, and acquaints the
House “that the other house have by their messenger sent certain bills,”
and then reads their titles, and delivers them to the clerk, to be
safely kept till they shall be called for to be read. _Hakew._, 178.

It is not the usage for one House to inform the other by what numbers a
bill has passed. _10 Grey_, 150. Yet they have sometimes recommended a
bill, as of great importance, to the consideration of the House to which
it is sent. 3 _Hats._, 25. Nor when they have rejected a bill from the
other house, do they give notice of it; but it passes sub silentio, to
prevent unbecoming altercations. 1 _Blackst._, 183.

[But in Congress the rejection is notified by message to the house in
which the bill originated.]

A question is never asked by the one house of the other by way of
message, but only at a conference; for this is an interrogatory, not a
message. 3 _Grey_, 151, 181.

When a bill is sent by one house to the other, and is neglected, they
may send a message to remind them of it. 3 _Hats._, 25; 5 _Grey_, 154.
But if it be mere inattention, it is better to have it done informally,
by communication between the Speakers or members of the two houses.

Where the subject of a message is of a nature that it can properly be
communicated to both Houses of Parliament, it is expected that this
communication should be made to both on the same day. But where a
message was accompanied with an original declaration, signed by the
party to which the message referred, its being sent to one house was not
noticed by the other, because the declaration, being original, could not
possibly be sent to both houses at the same time. 2 _Hats._, 260, 261,
262.

The King having sent original letters to the Commons, afterwards desires
they may be returned, that he may communicate them to the lords. _1
Chandler_, 303.


SECTION XLVIII.

ASSENT.

The house which has received a bill and passed it, may present it for
the King’s assent, and ought to do it, though they have not by message
notified to the other their passage of it. Yet the notifying by message
is a form which ought to be observed between the two houses, from
motives of respect and good understanding. 2 _Hats._, 142. Were the bill
to be withheld from being presented to the King, it would be an
infringement of the rules of Parliament. _Ib._

[When a bill has passed both houses of Congress, the house last acting
on it notifies its passage to the other, and delivers the bill to the
Joint Committee of Enrollment, who see that it is truly enrolled in
parchment.] When the bill is enrolled, it is not to be written in
paragraphs, but solidly, and all of a piece, that the blanks between the
paragraphs may not give room for forgery. _Grey_, 143. [It is then put
into the hands of the clerk of the House of Representatives to have it
signed by the Speaker. The clerk then brings it by way of message to the
Senate to be signed by their President. The Secretary of the Senate
returns it to the Committee of Enrollment, who present it to the
President of the United States. If he approve, he signs, and deposits it
among the rolls in the office of the Secretary of State, and notifies by
message the house in which it originated that he has approved and signed
it; of which that house informs the other by message. If the President
disapproves, he is to return it, with his objections, to that house in
which it shall have originated; who are to enter the objections at large
on their journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If, after such
reconsideration, two-thirds of that house shall agree to pass the bill,
it shall be sent, together with the President’s objections, to the other
house, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered; and if approved by
two-thirds of that house, it shall become a law. If any bill shall not
be returned by the President within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it
shall have been presented to him, the same shall be a law, in like
manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress, by its adjournment,
prevent its return; in which case it shall not be a law. _Const. U. S._,
I, 7.]

[Every order, resolution, or vote, to which the concurrence of the
Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary, (except on a
question of adjournment), shall be presented to the President of the
United States, and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved
by him; or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two-thirds of
the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the rules and
limitations prescribed in the case of a bill. _Const. U. S._, I, 7.]


SECTION XLIX.

JOURNALS.

[Each house shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and from time to
time publish the same, excepting such parts as may, in their judgment,
require secrecy. _Const._, I, 5.]

[The proceedings of the Senate, when not acting as in a Committee of the
Whole, shall be entered on the journals as concisely as possible, care
being taken to detail a true account of the proceedings. Every vote of
the Senate shall be entered on the journals, and a brief statement of
the contents of each petition, memorial, or paper presented to the
Senate, be also inserted on the journal. _Rule 33._]

[The titles of bills, and such parts thereof only, as shall be affected
by proposed amendments, shall be inserted on the journals. _Rule 32._]

If a question is interrupted by a vote to adjourn, or to proceed to the
orders of the day, the original question is never printed in the
journal, it never having been a vote, nor introductory to any vote; but
when suppressed by the previous question, the first question must be
stated, in order to introduce and make intelligible the second. _2
Hats._, 83.

So also when a question is postponed, adjourned, or laid on the table,
the original question, though not yet a vote, must be expressed in the
journals; because it makes part of the vote of postponement, adjourning,
or laying it on the table.

Where amendments are made to a question, those amendments are not
printed in the journals, separated from the question; but only the
question as finally agreed to by the House. The rule of entering in the
journals only what the House has agreed to, is founded in great prudence
and good sense; as there may be many questions proposed, which it may be
improper to publish to the world in the form in which they are made. _2
Hats._, 85.

[In both Houses of Congress, all questions whereon the yeas and nays
are desired by one-fifth of the members present, whether decided
affirmatively or negatively, must be entered on the journals. _Const._,
I, 5.]

The first order for printing the votes of the House of Commons was
October 30, 1685. 1 _Chandler_, 387.

Some judges have been of opinion that the journals of the House of
Commons are no records, but only remembrances. But this is not law.
_Hob._, 110, 111; _Lex. Parl._, 114, 115; _Journal H. C., Mar. 17,
1592_; _Hale. Parl._, 105. For the Lords in their house have power of
judicature, the Commons in their house have power of judicature; and
both houses together have power of judicature; and the Book of the Clerk
of the House of Commons is a record, as is affirmed by act of Parl., _6
H._ 8, _c._ 16; 4 _Inst._, 23, 24; and every member of the House of
Commons hath a judicial place. 4 _Inst._, 15. As records they are open
to every person, and a printed vote of either house is sufficient ground
for the other to notice it. Either may appoint a committee to inspect
the journals of the other, and report what has been done by the other in
any particular case. 2 _Hats._, 361; 3 _Hats._, 27-30. Every member has
a right to see the journals, and take and publish votes from them. Being
a record, every one may see and publish them. 6 _Grey_, 118, 119.

On information of a mis-entry or omission of an entry in the journal, a
committee may be appointed to examine and rectify it, and report it to
the House. 2 _Hats._, 194, 5.


SECTION L.

ADJOURNMENT.

The two Houses of Parliament have the sole, separate and independent
power of adjourning each their respective Houses. The King has no
authority to adjourn them; he can only signify his desire, and it is in
the wisdom and prudence of either house to comply with his requisition,
or not, as they see fitting. 2 _Hats._, 332; 1 _Blackstone_, 186; _5
Grey_, 122.

[By the Constitution of the United States a smaller number than a
majority may adjourn from day to day. I, 5. But “neither House, during
the session of Congress, shall, without the consent of the other,
adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other place than that in
which the two Houses shall be sitting.” I, 5. And in case of
disagreement between them, with respect to the time of adjournment, the
President may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper.
_Const._, II, 3.]

A motion to adjourn, simply, cannot be amended, as by adding “to a
particular day;” but must be put simply, “that this House do now
adjourn;” and if carried in the affirmative, it is adjourned to the next
sitting day, unless it has come to a previous resolution, “that at its
rising it will adjourn to a particular day,” and then the House is
adjourned to that day. 2 _Hats._, 82.

Where it is convenient that the business of the House be suspended for a
short time, as for a conference presently to be held, etc., it adjourns
during pleasure. 2 _Hats._, 305; or for a quarter of an hour. 5 _Grey_,
331.

If a question be put for adjournment, it is no adjournment till the
Speaker pronounces it. 5 _Grey_, 137. And from courtesy and respect, no
member leaves his place till the Speaker has passed on.


SECTION LI.

A SESSION.

Parliament have three modes of separation, to wit: By adjournment, by
prorogation or dissolution by the King, or by the efflux of the term for
which they were elected. Prorogation or dissolution constitutes there
what is called a session, provided some act has passed. In this case all
matters depending before them are discontinued, and at their next
meeting are to be taken up de novo, if taken up at all. 1 _Blackst._,
186. Adjournment, which is by themselves, is no more than a continuance
of the session from one day to another, or for a fortnight, a month,
etc., ad libitum. All matters depending remain in statu quo, and when
they meet again, be the term ever so distant, are resumed without any
fresh commencement, at the point at which they were left. 1 _Lev._, 165;
_Lex. Parl., c. 2_; 1 _Ro. Rep._, 29; 4 _Inst._, 7, 27, 28; _Hutt._, 61;
1 _Mod._, 252; _Ruffh. Jac. L. Dict. Parliament_; 1 _Blackst._, 186.
Their whole session is considered in law but as one day, and has
relation to the first day thereof. _Bro. Abr. Parliament_, 86.

Committees may be appointed to sit during a recess by adjournment but
not by prorogation. 5 _Grey_, 374; 9 _Grey_, 350; 1 _Chandler_, 50.
Neither house can continue any portion of itself in any parliamentary
function beyond the end of the session without the consent of the other
two branches. When done, it is by a bill constituting them commissioners
for the particular purpose.

[Congress separate in two ways only, to-wit: by adjournment, or
dissolution by the efflux of their time. What, then, constitutes a
session with them? A dissolution closes one session, and the meeting of
the new Congress begins another. The Constitution authorizes the
President, “on extraordinary occasions to convene both houses, or
either of them.” (I, 3) If convened by the President’s proclamation,
this must begin a new session, and of course determine the preceding one
to have been a session. So if it meets under the clause of the
Constitution, which says, “the Congress shall assemble at least once in
every year, and such meeting shall be on the first Monday in December,
unless they shall by law appoint a different day.” I, 4. This must begin
a new session; for even if the last adjournment was to this day, the act
of adjournment is merged in the higher authority of the Constitution,
and the meeting will be under that, and not under their adjournment. So
far, we have fixed landmarks for determining sessions. In other cases it
is declared by the joint vote authorizing the President of the Senate
and Speaker to close the session on a fixed day, which is usually in the
following form: “Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives,
that the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of
Representatives be authorized to close the present session by adjourning
their respective houses on the ---- day of ----.”]

When it was said above that all matters depending before Parliament were
discontinued by the determination of the session, it was not meant for
judiciary cases, depending before the House of Lords, such as
impeachments, appeals, and writs of error. These stand continued, of
course, to the next session. _Raym._, 120, 381; _Ruffh. Jack. L. D.
Parliament_.

[Impeachments stand, in like manner, continued before the Senate of the
United States.]


SECTION LII.

TREATIES.

[The President of the United States has power, by and with the advice
and consent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the
Senators present concur. _Const. U. S._, II, 2.]

[All confidential communications made by the President of the United
States to the Senate, shall be by the members thereof kept secret; and
that all treaties which may hereafter be laid before the Senate, shall
also be kept secret, until the Senate shall, by their resolution, take
off the injunction of secrecy. _Rule 39._]

Treaties are legislative acts. A treaty is the law of the land. It
differs from other laws only as it must have the consent of a foreign
nation, being but a contract with respect to that nation. In all
countries, I believe, except England, treaties are made by the
legislative power; and there also, if they touch the laws of the land,
they must be approved by Parliament. Ware vs. Hayton, 3 _Dallas’ Rep._,
223. It is acknowledged, for instance, that the King of Great Britain
cannot by a treaty make a citizen of an alien. _Vattel_, _b._ 1, _c._
19, _sec._ 214. An act of Parliament was necessary to validate the
American treaty of 1783. And abundant examples of such acts can be
cited. In the case of the treaty of Utrecht, in 1712, the commercial
articles required the concurrence of Parliament; but a bill brought in
for that purpose was rejected. France, the other contracting party,
suffered these articles, in practice, to be not insisted on, and adhered
to the rest of the treaty. 4 _Russel’s Hist. Mod. Europe_, 457; _2
Smollet_, 242, 246.

[By the Constitution of the United States this department of legislation
is confined to two branches only of the ordinary legislature; the
President originating, and the Senate having a negative. To what
subjects this power extends has not been defined in detail by the
Constitution; nor are we entirely agreed among ourselves. 1. It is
admitted that it must concern the foreign nation party to the contract,
or it would be a mere nullity, res inter alios acta. 2. By the general
power to make treaties, the Constitution must have intended to
comprehend only those subjects which are usually regulated by treaty,
and cannot be otherwise regulated. 3. It must have meant to except out
of these rights reserved to the States; for surely the President and
Senate cannot do by treaty what the whole government is interdicted from
doing in any way. 4. And also to except those subjects of legislation in
which it gave a participation to the House of Representatives. This last
exception is denied by some, on the ground that it would leave very
little matter for the treaty power to work on. The less the better, say
others. The Constitution thought it wise to restrain the Executive and
Senate from entangling and embroiling our affairs with those of Europe.
Besides, as the negotiations are carried on by the Executive alone, the
subjecting to the ratification of the representatives such articles as
are within their participation, is no more inconvenient than to the
Senate. But the ground of this exception is denied as unfounded. For
examine, _e. g._ the treaty of commerce with France, and it will be
found that, out of thirty-one articles, there are not more than small
portions of two or three of them which would not still remain as
subjects of treaties, untouched by these exceptions.]

Treaties being declared, equally with the laws of the United States, to
be the supreme law of the land, it is understood that an act of the
legislature alone can declare them infringed and rescinded. This was
accordingly the process adopted in the case of France in 1798.

[It has been the usage for the Executive, when it communicates a treaty
to the Senate for their ratification, to communicate also the
correspondence of the negotiators. This having been omitted in case of
the Prussian treaty, was asked by a vote of the House, of February 12,
1800, and was obtained. And in December, 1800, the convention of that
year between the United States and France, with the report of the
negotiations by the envoys, but not their instructions, being laid
before the Senate, the instructions were asked for, and communicated by
the President.]

[The mode of voting on questions of ratification is by nominal call.]

[Whenever a treaty shall be laid before the Senate for ratification, it
shall be read a first time for information only; when no motion to
reject, ratify, or modify the whole, or any part, shall be received. Its
second reading shall be for consideration, and on a subsequent day, when
it shall be taken up as in a committee of the whole, and every one shall
be free to move a question on any particular article, in this form:
“Will the Senate advise and consent to the ratification of this
article?” or to propose amendments thereto, either by inserting or by
leaving out words, in which last case the question shall be: “Shall the
words stand part of the article?” And in every of the said cases, the
concurrence of two-thirds of the Senators present shall be requisite to
decide affirmatively. And when, through the whole, the proceedings shall
be stated to the House, and questions be again severally put thereon,
for confirmation, or new ones proposed, requiring in like manner a
concurrence of two-thirds for whatever is retained or inserted.]

[The votes so confirmed shall, by the House, or a committee thereof, be
reduced into the form of a ratification, with or without modifications,
as may have been decided, and shall be proposed on a subsequent day,
when every one shall again be free to move amendments, either by
inserting or leaving out words; in which last case the question shall
be: “Shall the words stand part of the resolution?” And in both cases
the concurrence of two-thirds shall be requisite to carry the
affirmative; as well as on the final question to advise and consent to
the ratification in the form agreed to. _Rule 37._]

[When any question may have been decided by the Senate, in which
two-thirds of the members present are necessary to carry the
affirmative, any member who voted on that side which prevailed in the
question may be at liberty to move for a reconsideration, and a motion
for reconsideration shall be decided by a majority of votes. _Rule
37._]


SECTION LIII.

IMPEACHMENT.

[The House of Representatives shall have the sole power of impeachment.
_Const. U. S._, I, 3.]

[The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. When
sitting for that purpose, they shall be on oath or affirmation. When the
President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall
preside; and no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of
two-thirds of the members present. Judgment in cases of impeachment
shall not extend further than to removal from office, and
disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit
under the United States. But the party convicted shall nevertheless be
liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment
according to law. _Const._, I, 3.]

[The President, Vice-President, and all civil officers of the United
States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction
of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. _Const._,
II, 4.]

[The trial of crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury.
_Const._, III, 2.]

These are the provisions of the Constitution of the United States on the
subject of impeachments. The following is a sketch of some of the
principles and practices of England on the same subject:

_Jurisdiction._ The Lords cannot impeach any to themselves, nor join in
the accusation, because they are the judges. _Seld. Judic. in Parl._,
12, 63. Nor can they proceed against a commoner but on complaint of the
Commons. _Ib._, 84. The Lords may not, by the law, try a commoner for a
capital offense, on the information of the King or a private person,
because the accused is entitled to a trial by his peers generally; but
on accusation by the House of Commons, they may proceed against the
delinquent, of whatsoever degree, and whatsoever be the nature of the
offense; for there they do not assume to themselves trial at common law.
The commons are then instead of a jury, and the judgment is given on
their demand, which is instead of a verdict. So the Lords do only judge,
but not try the delinquent. _Ib._ 6, 7. But Wooddeson denies that a
commoner can now be charged capitally before the Lords, even by the
Commons; and cites Fitzharris’s case, 1681, impeached for high treason,
where the Lords remitted the prosecution to the inferior court. _8
Grey’s Deb._, 325-7; _Wooddeson_, 601, 576; 3 _Seld._, 1610, 1619, 1641;
4 _Blackst._, 25; _73 Seld._, 1604, 1618; 9, 1656.

_Accusation._ The Commons, as the grand inquest of the nation, become
suitors for penal justice. 2 _Woodd._, 597; 6 _Grey_, 356. The general
course is to pass a resolution containing a criminal charge against the
supposed delinquent, and then to direct some member to impeach him by
oral accusation, at the bar of the House of Lords, in the name of the
Commons. The person signifies that the articles will be exhibited, and
desires that the delinquent may be sequestered from his seat, or be
committed, or that the peers will take order from his appearance.
_Sachev. Trial_, 325; _Woodd._, 602, 605; _Lords’ Jour. 3 June, 1701_,
101; 1 _Wms._, 616; 6 _Grey_, 324.

_Process._ If a party do not appear, proclamations are to be issued,
giving him a day to appear. On their return they are strictly examined.
If any error be found in them, a new proclamation issues, giving a short
day. If he appear not, his goods may be arrested and they may proceed.
_Seld. Jud._, 98, 99.

_Articles._ The accusation (articles) of the Commons is substituted in
place of an indictment. Thus, by the usage of Parliament, in impeachment
for writing or speaking, the particular words need not be specified.
_Sach. Tr._, 325; 2 _Woodd._, 602, 605; _Lords’ Jour., 3 June, 1701_; _1
Wms._, 616.

_Appearance._ If he appears, and the case be capital, he answers in
custody; though not if the accusations be general. He is not to be
committed but on special accusations. If it be for a misdemeanor only,
he answers a Lord in his place, a Commoner at the bar, and not in
custody, unless on the answer the Lords find cause to commit him, till
he finds sureties to attend, and lest he should fly. _Seld. Jud._, 98,
99. A copy of the articles is given him, and a day fixed for his answer.
_T. Ray_; 1 _Rushw._, 268; _Fost._, 232; 1 _Clar. Hist. of the Reb._,
379. On a misdemeanor, his appearance may be in person, or he may answer
in writing, or by attorney. _Seld. Jud._, 100. The general rule on
accusation for a misdemeanor is, that in such a state of liberty or
restraint as the party is when the Commons complain of him, in such he
is to answer. _Ib._, 101. If previously committed by the Commons, he
answers as a prisoner. But this may be called in some sort judicium
parium snorum. _Ib._ In misdemeanors the party has a right to counsel by
the common law; but not in capital cases. _Seld. Jud._, 102-5.

_Answer._ The answer need not observe great strictness of form. He may
plead guilty as to part, and defend as to the residue; or, saving all
exceptions, deny the whole or give a particular answer to each article
separately. 1 _Rush._, 274; 1 _Rush._, 1374; _12 Parl. Hist._, 442; _3
Lords’ Journ., 13 Nov., 1643_; _Woodd._, 607. But he cannot plead a
pardon in bar to the impeachment. 2 _Woodd._, 615; 2 _St. Tr._, 735.

_Replication, rejoinder, etc._ There may be a replication, rejoinder,
etc. _Seld. Jud._, 114; 8 _Grey’s Deb._, 233; _Sach. Tr._, 15; _Journ.
H. of Commons, 6 March, 1640_, 1.

_Witnesses._ The practice is to swear the witnesses in open House, and
then examine them there; or a committee may be named, who shall examine
them in committee, either on interrogatories agreed on in the House, or
such as the committee in their discretion shall demand. _Seld. Jud._,
120, 123.

_Jury._ In the case of Alice Pierce, 1 _R._ 2, a jury was impanneled for
her trial before a committee. _Seld. Jud._, 123. But this was on a
complaint, not on impeachment by the commons. _Seld. Jud._, 163. It must
also have been for a misdemeanor only, as the lords spiritual sat in the
case, which they do on misdemeanors, but not in capital cases. _Id._,
148. The judgment was a forfeiture of all her lands and goods. _Id._,
188. This, Seldon says, is the only jury he finds recorded in Parliament
for misdemeanor; but he makes no doubt, if the delinquent doth put
himself on trial of his country, a jury ought to be impanneled, and he
adds that it is not so on impeachment by the commons; for they are in
loco proprio, and there no jury ought to be impanneled. _Id._ 124. The
Ld. Berkely (6 _E._ 3) was arraigned for the murder of L. 2, on an
information on the part of the King, and not on impeachment of the
commons; for then they had been patria sua. He waived his peerage, and
was tried by a jury of Gloucestershire and Warwickshire. _Id._, 125. In
1 H. 7, the commons protest that they are not to be considered as
parties to any judgment given, or hereafter to be given in Parliament.
_Seld. Jud._, 133. They have been generally and more justly considered,
as is before stated, as the grand jury; for the conceit of Seldom is
certainly not accurate, and they are the patria sua of the accused, and
that the lords do only judge, but not try. It is undeniable that they do
try; for they examine witnesses as to the facts, and acquit or condemn,
according to their own belief of them. And Lord Hale says “the peers are
judges of law as well as of fact;” 2 _Hale, P. C._, 275; consequently of
fact as well as of law.

_Presence of Commons._ The commons are to be present at the examination
of witnesses. _Seld. Jud._, 124. Indeed, they are to attend throughout,
either as a committee of the whole House, or otherwise, at discretion,
appoint managers to conduct the proofs. _Rushw. Tr. of Straff._, 37;
_Com. Journ., 4 Feb., 1709-10_; 2 _Woodd._, 614. And judgment is not to
be given till they demand it. _Seld. Jud._, 124. But they are not to be
present on impeachment when the lords consider of the answer of proofs
and determine of their judgment. Their presence, however, is necessary
at the answer and judgment in cases capital (_Id._, 58, 159) as well as
not capital; (162.) The lords debate the judgment among themselves. Then
the vote is first taken on the question of guilty or not guilty; and if
they convict, the question, or particular sentence, is out of that which
seemeth to be most generally agreed on. _Seld. Jud._, 167; 2 _Woodd._,
612.

_Judgment._ Judgments in Parliament, for death, have been strictly
guided per legem terræ, which they cannot alter; and not at all
according to their discretion. They can neither omit any legal part of
the judgment nor add to it. Their sentence must be secundum, non ultra
legem. _Seld. Jud._, 168-171. This trial, though it varies in external
ceremony, yet differs not in essentials from criminal prosecutions
before inferior courts. The same rules of evidence, the same legal
notions of crimes and punishments, prevailed; for impeachments are not
framed to alter the law, but to carry it into more effectual execution
against too powerful delinquents. The judgment, therefore, is to be such
as is warranted by legal principles or precedents. 6 _Sta. Tr._, 14; _2
Woodd._, 611. The Chancellor gives judgment in misdemeanors; the Lord
High Steward formerly in cases of life and death. _Seld. Jud._, 180. But
now the Steward is deemed not necessary. _Fost._, 144; 2 _Woodd._, 613.
In misdemeanors the greatest corporal punishment hath been imprisonment.
_Seld. Jud._, 184. The King’s assent is necessary in capital judgments
(2 _Woodd._, 614, contra), but not in misdemeanors. _Seld. Jud._, 136.

_Continuance._ An impeachment is not discontinued by the dissolution of
Parliament, but may be resumed by the new Parliament. _T. Ray._, 383; _4
Com. Journ., 23 Dec., 1790_; _Lords’ Journ., May 15, 1791_; 2 _Woodd._,
618.

MANUAL OF CUSTOMS, PRECEDENTS AND FORMS.


ORGANIZATION.

The Legislature convenes at 12 o’clock M. on the first Wednesday in
January A. D. 1879, and at 12 o’clock M. on the first Wednesday in
January of each alternate year forever thereafter, and at other times
when convened by the Governor.

Custom, so prevalent and so ancient as to have the force of law, has
made it the duty of the clerk of the previous house to call to order,
and to conduct the proceedings generally, until a speaker is chosen, but
any member elect is competent to perform this duty.

In other States it is the custom for the Secretary of State to furnish
to the clerk a certified statement of the names of the members elect,
which is read. The members then advance to the clerk’s desk, generally
the delegation of each county by itself, and subscribe the oath of
office. But in this State the usual proceeding is to choose a Speaker
and a clerk _pro tem._, and to appoint a committee who examine
credentials of members elect, and report to the House thus temporarily
organized.

The oath of office is then administered to the members elect. It may be
administered by the President of the Senate, the Governor, Secretary of
State, Attorney General, or any of the Judges of the Supreme Court. It
has been administered in this State usually by one of the judges.
[_Members coming in after the first day of the session are sworn in by
the Speaker._] After all are sworn, the roll is called, when, if a
quorum is found present, the Speaker _pro tem._ declares the House to be
qualified and competent to proceed to business.

If the members present have determined their choice for officers, the
election proceeds forthwith; if not, an adjournment is had until the
next day.

It is determined by the House whether the election for Speaker, Clerk,
and Sergeant-at-arms and the subordinate officers shall be by ballot,
viva voce, or otherwise.

Candidates for Speaker are nominated and the vote taken.

The Speaker _pro tem._ announces the result, and names a committee to
conduct the Speaker elect to the chair. The other elections proceed in
the same manner, except that when the result is announced by the
Speaker, the officer elect advances to the Clerk’s desk and is sworn in
by the Speaker.

A committee is then appointed to wait on the Senate, and inform them
that the House is organized; or the Clerk is directed, by resolution, to
inform the Senate of the fact.

One of the first duties after organization is the adoption of rules for
the government of the House.

It is customary for the Speaker to appoint a committee of three to meet
with a committee of three from the Senate for the purpose of forming
joint rules for the government of both houses; and when completed, the
committees report to their respective houses.

By concurrent resolution both houses meet in joint convention to canvass
the vote for executive officers.

When it has been determined who are the executive officers, a joint
committee of both houses is then appointed to wait on the Governor and
inform him that both Houses of the General Assembly are organized, and
that the houses are in readiness to receive any communication from him.

The Senate and House usually assemble in joint convention in the chamber
of the House upon some day and hour suggested by the Governor, during
the first week of the session to hear his message.

The message is usually read by the Executive, but may be read by his
private secretary, or by any one the Governor may appoint.

At the first opportunity after hearing the message read, the various
recommendations therein contained are referred, by resolution, to
appropriate standing committees, or select committees.

Standing committees are appointed by the Speaker at as early a day in
the session as is possible. Each committee usually consists of five
members, but the House determines the number which is sometimes three,
or nine, or eleven, or any other number.


DRAWING OF SEATS.

In other States the seats are drawn by lot. The method pursued is as
follows:

The members leave their seats, and take places in the open area behind
their seats. The clerk having placed in a box slips of paper containing
the names of the members respectively, a page or messenger draws them
therefrom. The clerk announces each name as it is drawn, and the member
named selects his seat, and occupies it until the drawing is completed.

In this State it is not customary to draw seats by any method. The seats
are usually chosen with the view of grouping together those who
represent similar interests.


COMPENSATION.

Each member of the General Assembly, as a compensation for his services
shall receive four dollars for each day’s attendance, and fifteen cents
for every mile necessarily travelled in going to and returning from the
seat of government, and shall receive no other compensation, perquisite,
or allowance whatsoever. It is customary to pay the mileage of members
both ways, upon the certificate of the Speaker and clerk as to the
proper sum to which each member is entitled.


PAY OF OFFICERS.

The Speaker of the House shall be entitled to receive the same
compensation allowed to other members of the Legislature. The per diem
of officers of the Legislature shall be as follows: The chief clerk, six
dollars; the assistant clerk, five dollars; sergeant-at-arms, assistant
sergeant-at-arms, engrossing clerk, assistant engrossing clerk, and
enrolling clerk, each four dollars; messenger, door-keeper, janitor, and
interpreter, each three dollars; chaplain, two dollars; pages, assistant
door-keeper, and janitor, each one dollar and fifty cents.


DUTIES OF OFFICERS.

_Speaker_--The duties of this officer are generally as follows:

To open the session, at the time to which the House stands adjourned, by
taking the chair and calling the members to order.

To announce the business before the House in the order in which it is to
be acted upon.

To receive and submit, in the proper manner, all motions and
propositions presented by the members.

To put to vote all questions which are regularly moved, or which
necessarily arise in the course of proceedings, and to announce the
result.

To restrain the members, when engaged in debate, within the rules of
order.

To enforce on all occasions the observance of order and decorum among
the members.

To inform the House, when necessary, or when referred to for the
purpose, on a point of order or practice.

To receive messages and other communications from other branches of the
government, and announce them to the House.

To authenticate by his signature, when necessary, all the acts, orders
and proceedings of the House.

To name the members--when directed to do so in a particular case, or
when it is a part of his general duty by the rules--who are to serve on
committees, and in general.

To represent and stand for the House, declaring its will, and in all
things obeying its commands. Every officer of the House is subordinate
to the Speaker, and in all that relates to the prompt and correct
discharge of official duty, is under his supervision.

The Speaker shall preserve order and decorum; may speak to points of
order in preference to others, rising from his seat for that purpose;
and he shall decide questions of order, subject to an appeal to the
House by any member, on which appeal no member shall speak more than
once, unless by leave of the House. On an appeal being taken, the
question shall be: “Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the
judgment of the House?”----which question, and the action of the House
thereon, shall be entered on the journal.

The Speaker may call a member to the Chair, but such substitution shall
not extend beyond one day, except by leave of the House.

The Speaker shall vote on all questions taken by yeas and nays, and on
all elections or divisions called for by any member.

In the absence of the Speaker, the House shall elect a Speaker _pro
tempore_, whose office shall cease on the return of the Speaker.

_Clerk_--He has the care and custody of all the papers and records, and
arranges in its proper order, from day to day, after its inception, all
the business of the House. He must, in order to have a proper knowledge
of the affairs of his department, apportion, systematize and personally
supervise the labor of all his subordinates, and, when not called
therefrom by more important duties, should officiate in person at the
reading desk. The duties of his subordinates are properly his duties, as
all are performed under his direction, and he is responsible for any
deficiencies. It is his duty to prepare and furnish to the printer an
accurate record of each day’s proceedings, and a copy of every bill,
report and other thing ordered to be printed, “on the same day such
orders are made;” to keep the pay accounts of members and officers, and
issue his certificate of per diem to them; to deliver the messages of
the House to the Senate; to sign subpœnas; he can permit no records nor
papers belonging to the House to be taken out of his custody, otherwise
than in the regular course of business; and shall report any missing
papers to the notice of the Speaker.

He is by law responsible for the safe keeping of all bills and other
documents in possession of the House, and for the proper registry of all
proceedings; and is required at the close of the session, to deposit all
papers in his possession as clerk, properly classified and labeled, with
the Secretary of State.

person any bill or other document in their possession without leave of
the clerk.

Perfect courtesy must at all times be maintained towards members,
reporters, associate deputies, and all who have business to transact
with the department; but interference with legislation cannot be allowed
under any circumstances.

_To Members, Officers and Reporters_--It is especially requested that no
member, officer or reporter will interrupt the assistant clerk while

required by the members, the clerk and other officers.


NEWSPAPERS.

In regard to the supply of newspapers there are no regulations. The
House determines what papers, and how many, shall be furnished.


PROCESS OF PASSING BILLS.

Some diversity of practice exists herein, but the ordinary method in the
House is as follows:

A member having prepared a bill and endorsed the title thereof, together
with his name, upon the back of it, rises to his feet, at such time as
the introduction of bills is in order, and says:

“Mr. Speaker.”

If recognized, the Speaker responds:

“The gentleman from ----.”

The member announces:

“I ask leave to introduce a bill.”

The bill is then sent to the Clerk by a messenger. The Clerk then reads
the title of the bill, and places it on file for its first reading, and
when the order for the first reading of bills is reached, the Clerk
reads the first bill on file _at length_, when the Speaker announces:

“First reading of the bill.”

The second reading of bills must be on a day subsequent to their first
reading. When the Speaker calls for the second reading of bills, the
Clerk reads the first bill on file for second reading _at length_, when
the Speaker announces:

“Second reading of the bill.”

The bill is then usually referred to such standing committee, or select
committee, or to the general file for Committee of the Whole, as the
House may determine.

If the bill has been referred to a standing committee, or select
committee, it is in due course reported back to the House by the
committee, when it is placed in the general file.

Bills in the general file are usually considered in Committee of the
Whole in the exact order in which they are placed upon the file.
Proceedings in Committee of the Whole will be elsewhere considered.

After a Committee of the Whole has completed its action upon any bill,
and reported the same back to the House, and any recommendations made by
the committee passed upon, it is taken up in its order, when the Speaker
puts the following question:

“Shall this bill be engrossed, and read a third time?”

If decided affirmatively the bill is thereby referred to the engrossing
committee. Upon its return engrossed from the engrossing clerk, the
original and engrossed bills are placed in the hands of the _Committee
on Engrossed Bills_, who compare them and correct any errors which they
may find. When found correct, or made so, the committee report them to
the House as correctly engrossed, when the original is filed by the
Clerk, and the engrossed bill goes into the order of “bills ready for a
third reading.”

When, under the order of business, the bill is reached, the title of the
bill is read, and the bill itself is read _at length_, when the Speaker
says as follows:

“This bill having been read three several times, the question is: Shall
the bill pass?”

If the bill passes it is taken to the Senate, with a message announcing
its passage by the House, and asking the concurrence of the Senate
therein.

Going through with a similar process in the Senate, it is returned with
a message announcing their action upon it.

If the Senate concurs, the bill is sent to the Enrolling Clerk, who
makes a copy thereof, as is elsewhere described. When enrolled, it goes
to the _Committee on Enrolled Bills_, who compare it with the engrossed
bill. When found or made correct, they report the bill to the House as
correctly enrolled; the engrossed bill is filed by the Clerk; the
enrolled bill is then endorsed by the Clerk as having originated in the
House (for the information of the Governor, in case he vetoes it). It is
then referred to a joint committee of enrollment, who present the same
to the Speaker, who has the title of the bill read in hearing of the
House, and then signs it, after which the joint committee present the
bill to the President of the Senate, who has the title of the bill read
in hearing of the Senate, and then signs it. The committee then proceed
to the Governor and present the bill thus duly signed for his approval,
and report that fact to the House, and the hour when it was deposited in
the Governor’s hands. The Governor, if he approves the bill, informs the
House in which it originated of that fact, and that he has deposited it
with the Secretary of State.

This is the ordinary process of a bill through all its stages until it
becomes a law. A bill of great interest or importance, or one which is
warmly contested, may, by reason of majority and minority reports,
special orders, recommitment, amendments, substitutes, committees of
conference, and various other parliamentary appliances, pass through a
vast number of stages not before enumerated.

Senate bills coming into the House after passing the Senate, are read
twice by title and then read _at length_, and then referred to the
appropriate committee.

After consideration in Committee of the Whole, the recommendation of
the committee is acted upon in the House, the question being, after
recommendations are disposed of:

“Shall this bill be ordered to a third reading?”

If it is decided affirmatively, the bill passes into the order of “bills
on third reading;” and when reached in that order, the question is:

“Shall this bill be concurred in?”

If concurred in, the bill is returned to the Senate, with the message
informing it of that fact.


COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE.

The Committee of the Whole is an expedient to simplify the business of
legislative bodies. No record is made of its proceedings, and it has no
officers except of its own creation, for temporary purposes. It is
liable to instant dissolution in case of disorder, when the Speaker
takes the chair for a Call of the House, or an adjournment, and in case
of a message from the Senate or Governor, when the Speaker takes the
chair to receive it.

The House may resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole upon some
particular bill, resolution or subject, or it may go into Committee of
the Whole upon the general file of bills.

In the first case the motion is:

“That the House do now resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole upon
[bill No. ----, A, a bill ----], or [joint resolution No. ----, A,
providing, etc.], or [upon all bills relating to ----], as the case may
be.”

In the second case it is:

“That the House do now resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole upon
the general file of bills.”

Bills, resolutions, and general matters which have been once considered
in committee of the whole, and in which progress has been made, and
leave granted for further consideration, have the preference. The motion
of the Committee of the Whole, for their further consideration, must be
made under the head of “bills in which the committee of the whole have
made progress and obtained leave to sit again;” and in which case the
member who presided when the same matter was previously considered in
committee of the whole, resumes the chair.

The motion for the committee of the whole upon the general file, must
be made under the order of “bills not yet considered in committee of the
whole.”

When the House resolves itself into committee of the whole, the Speaker
selects a chairman as follows:

“The gentleman from ----, Mr ----, will take the chair.”

The appointed chairman advances to the Speaker’s desk, and having taken
the chair, receives from the clerk the papers indicated by the motion
for the committee, when the chairman announces:

“Gentlemen,--The committee have under consideration bill No. ----,
entitled ----” (_reading the title from the back of the bill_). _Or in
case of consideration of the general file_: “The committee have under
consideration the general file of bills; the first in order is bill No.
----, A, entitled ----. The first section is as follows.”

The chairman then reads the first section, and asks:

“Are there any amendments proposed to the first section?”

If none are offered, the chairman says:

“No amendments being offered to the first section, the second section
will be read.”

This process is continued through the whole bill, when at the close of
the reading the chairman says:

“The ----th section and the whole bill have now been read, and are open
to amendment.”

At this point, after the friends of the bill have perfected it, it is
customary for the opponents of the bill to open their attack. After the
discussion of the bill to such an extent as may be desired, if no
amendments are made, the final vote is generally upon a motion--

“That the bill be reported back to the House without amendment.”

If any other bills are before the committee, they are proceeded with in
the same manner. If it is desired to have further consideration of any
matter before the committee, or if the general file has not been gone
through with, the motion is:

“That the committee rise, report progress, and ask leave to sit again.”

If the committee has completed its duties, the motion is:

“That the committee rise and report.”

Which being analagous to a motion to adjourn, is not debatable. The
chairman states the matter as follows:

“It is moved that the committee do now rise and report (_or otherwise,
as the case may be_).”

“Is the committee ready for the question?”

“Gentlemen,--Those who are of opinion that this committee do now rise
and report, say ‘Aye;’ those of a contrary opinion say ‘No.’”

In case of doubt a division must be had, as the ayes and noes cannot be
called in committee of the whole.

When the committee rises, the Speaker resumes his seat, and the
chairman, in his place on the floor, reports as follows:

“Mr. Speaker.”

The Speaker answers:

“Mr. Chairman.”

Who reports:

“The committee of the whole have had under consideration bill No. ----,
A, entitled ----, and have instructed me to report the same to the House
with amendment” (_or as the case may be_).

When the general file has been under consideration, the report is as
follows:

“The committee of the whole have had under consideration the general
file of bills, have gone through the same, and have directed me to
report to the House the bills contained therein, with sundry amendments
and recommendations as follows, to-wit:” [_Here follows the titles of
bills considered, with action taken upon them._]

In case the file has been left unfinished, the report is:

“The committee of the whole have had under consideration the general
file of bills, and have made some progress therein. I am directed to
report back the following bills, with the amendments and recommendations
hereinafter specified, and ask leave for the committee to sit again.”
[_Here follows the report of amendments, etc., as above._]

In the latter report the question is:

“Shall leave be granted?”

When, upon a count, it is ascertained that a quorum is not present, the
report is:

“The committee of the whole have had under consideration ----, and,
after some progress therein, find there is no quorum present; that fact
I herewith report to you.”

In case of confusion or disorder, the Speaker, of his own accord,
resumes the chair temporarily and without any formality, for the purpose
of suppressing it. When order is restored the chairman resumes the
chair, and the business proceeds.

Upon the coming in of a report, the recommendations are usually at once
acted on by the House.

When, in committee of the whole, any member desires to offer an
amendment, it must be reduced to writing and sent to the chairman, who
reads it, and asks:

“Is the committee ready for the question upon the amendment?”

And if no further amendment or debate offer, he puts the question in the
usual manner.

After a section is once passed, with an unsuccessful effort to amend it,
no further amendments are in order. The strictness of this rule is,
however, not always adhered to; an amendment once made may, however, be
reconsidered. Such a motion is:

“That the amendment offered by the gentleman from ----, to the ----th
section, be reconsidered.”

And is stated as follows:

“The gentleman from ---- moves that the amendment of the gentleman from
---- to the ----th section be reconsidered.”

“Is the committee ready for the question?”

“Those who are of the opinion that said amendment be reconsidered say
‘Aye;’ those of the contrary opinion say ‘No.’”

In case the amendment is reconsidered, the Speaker says:

“The motion is carried. The amendment is reconsidered. The question now
recurs upon the adoption of the amendment. Is the committee ready for
the question?” etc.

  MR. GORDEN.

Resolutions should not be entitled, but should have the name of the
mover endorsed upon them. The same rule applies to amendments.

Resolutions are of no special form; the following may serve as a general
guide in such matters:

Res. No. ----, A.

“_Resolved_,--That three thousand copies of the Governor’s message be
furnished by the printer to the Sergeant-at-Arms, for the use of the
House.

  “MR. TUCKER.”

For reports the following form is used:

“The committee on ----, to which was referred bill No. ----, A., a bill
to ----, _respectfully report the same back to the House with an
amendment, and recommend its passage when amended_;” or, “_and recommend

It must _invariably_ be in the following form:

_Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado: Const.,
Art. 5, Sec. 18._


INVESTIGATIONS.

When an investigation is required into any matter, the person most
interested in having the inquiry made, should move the appointment of a
committee to take the subject in charge. This is done by resolution. The
resolution should be so drawn as to state the precise subject to be
investigated, and to give the committee all the power which the mover
may deem necessary to a thorough examination into the subject matter to
be laid before them; this should be done to prevent any misapprehension
as to the intention and extent of the inquiry to be made. In case of the
adoption of the resolution, the mover, together with other members, will
be appointed a committee. They have power to send for persons and
papers. The form of a subpœna is as follows:

  “THE STATE OF COLORADO, }

“To ---- ----: You are hereby commanded, that, laying aside all business
and excuse, you personally appear and attend before Messrs. ---- ----,
on the part of the Senate, and Messrs. ---- ----, on the part of the
House, a _joint_ committee appointed under a resolution of the Senate
and House, to investigate at the room of said committee ----, in the
city of Denver, the capital of the State, on the ---- day of -----, A.
D. one thousand eight hundred and ----, at the hour of ---- in the ----
noon, then and there, and from time to time, as required by said
committee, to testify and give evidence upon the matters of inquiry
before said committee.

“Hereof fail not, under penalty in such case made and provided.

“Given at the House chamber, in the city of Denver aforesaid, this ----
day of ----, A. D. 18----.

  “---- ----, _Speaker of the House_.

“Attest: ---- ----, _Chief Clerk of the House_.”

In case of a refusal to appear, or a refusal to testify, the following
form of certificate has been used:

“To Hon. ---- ----, _Speaker of the House_:

“I, ---- ----, chairman of the _joint_ committee appointed to
investigate ----, do hereby certify that ---- has been duly subpœnaed to
appear before said committee, as will fully appear by the writ served,
and affidavit of service accompanying the same, on file with the chief
clerk of the House.

“I further certify that said ---- ---- has failed to appear before said
committee, according to the exigency or mandate of said writ or subpœna.

“Dated Denver, ----, 18----, at ---- o’clock.

  ---- ----.”

Upon which a warrant, in the following form, may be used:

“_The State of Colorado to the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House_:

“It appearing that a writ of subpœna, directed to ---- ----, commanding
him to personally appear and attend before Messrs. ---- ----, on the
part of the Senate, and Messrs. ---- ----, on the part of the House, a
_joint_ committee appointed under a resolution of the Senate and House,
to investigate ---- ----, at the room of said committee, in the city of
Denver, the capital of the State, the ---- day of ----, A. D. 18----, at
the hour of ---- in the ---- noon, then and there, and from time to
time, as required by said committee, to testify and give evidence upon
the matter of inquiry before said committee, has been issued, and that
the said writ of subpœna was duly and personally served upon the said
---- ----, on the day of ----, A. D. 18----, and returned; and it
further appearing by the certificate of the chairman of the said joint
committee, that the said ---- ---- has failed or neglected to appear
before the said committee in obedience to the mandate of the said
subpœna: _therefore_, you are hereby commanded, the name of the State of
Colorado, to take the body of him, the said ---- ----, and bring him
before the House, so that he may testify and give evidence before the
said committee, and answer for his contempt of the House in not obeying
the mandate of said subpœna. Hereof fail not.

“Given at the House chamber, in the city of Denver aforesaid, this ----
day of ----, A. D. 18----.

  “---- ----, _Speaker of the House_.

  “---- ----, _Chief Clerk of House_.”

To which the return, in ordinary cases, would be:

“By virtue of the within process, I did, on the ---- day of ----, 18--,
arrest the body of ---- ----, and took him before the committee within
named, and the said ---- ---- having refused to answer interrogatories
propounded by said committee, I have him, by direction of said
committee, now before the House.

  “House Chamber, ----, 18--.

  “---- ----, _Sergeant-at-Arms of the House_.”

A resolution, declaring the defaulter to be in contempt, is the next
proceeding.

The following is a form for such resolution:

“_Resolved_, That the neglect or failure of ---- ---- to appear before
the joint investigating committee, composed of Messrs. ---- ----, of the
Senate, and Messrs. ---- ----, of the House, in compliance with the
mandate of the writ of subpœna of this House, served upon him on the
---- instant, as fully appears by the said writ and affidavit of the
service thereof endorsed thereon, now on file with the Chief Clerk of
this House, be and the said neglect and failure is hereby declared a
contempt of this House.”

This is followed by an interrogatory, as follows:

“Int. 1.--Why did you not appear before the _joint_ investigating
committee, as required by the mandate of the subpœna served upon you the
---- instant?”

To which the defaulter pleads before judgment is inflicted.

Another form is as follows:

“_Resolved_, That the refusal of ---- ---- to answer the questions put
to him by a member of the _joint_ investigating committee, on the ----
instant, and which questions were certified to the House by ---- ----,
chairman of said committee; and are now in writing, on file with the
Chief Clerk of the House, be, and the same is hereby declared a contempt
of this House.”

Followed by the corresponding interrogatory:

“Why did you not answer the question put or propounded to you on the
---- instant, by a member of the _joint_ investigating committee, of
which ---- ---- is chairman?”

In case the answer is satisfactory, the offender is discharged; if
otherwise, he is punished by reprimand, fine or imprisonment, or both;
but such imprisonment cannot extend beyond the session of the
Legislature.

The report of a Committee on Investigation should consist of three
parts:

1. The testimony taken.

2. A statement of the facts proven thereby, or conclusions derived
therefrom.

3. Resolutions, or a bill providing for the action which the committee
deem proper to be taken in the premises.


QUORUMS.

Whole number electable:

“Not less than 25 nor more than 49.”

a motion to strike out and insert one proposition shall not prevent a
motion to strike out and insert a different proposition, nor prevent a
subsequent motion simply to strike out, nor shall the rejection of a
motion simply to strike out, prevent a subsequent motion to strike out
and insert.

which the vote was taken, shall have gone out of the possession of the

ascertained under the census of 1860 was 126,823; and upon this basis
the 233 Representatives were apportioned among the several States, one
Representative for every district containing that number of persons;
giving to each State at least one Representative. Subsequently, by the

Representatives from and after March 3, 1863, was increased from 233 to
241, by allowing one additional Representative to each of the following
States, viz: Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania,

[38] RULE 23. The Vice-President or President of the Senate pro tempore,
shall have the right to name a member to perform the duties of the
Chair; but such substitution shall not extend beyond an amendment.

[39] RULE 34. The following Standing Committees, shall be appointed at
the commencement of each session, with leave to report by bill or
otherwise.

or creating a charge on the same.

A Committee on Engrossed Bills, to consist of three members, whose duty
it shall be to examine all bills, amendments, resolutions or motions,
before they go out of the possession of the Senate, and shall deliver
the same to the Secretary of the Senate, who shall enter upon the
journal that the same have been correctly engrossed.

A Committee on Enrolled Bills, to consist of three members.

[40] The former practice of the Senate referred to in this paragraph has
been changed by the following Rule:

[RULE 29. The final question upon the second reading of every bill,
resolution, constitutional amendment or motion, originating in the
Senate, and requiring three readings previous to being passed, shall be,
“Whether it shall be engrossed and read a third time?” and no amendment
shall be received for discussion at the third reading of any bill,
resolution, amendment, or motion, unless by unanimous consent of the
members present; but it shall at all times be in order before the final
passage of any such bill, resolution, constitutional amendment, or
motion, to move its commitment; and should such commitment take place,
and any amendment be reported by the committee, the said bill,
resolution, constitutional amendment, or motion, shall be again read a
second time, and considered as in Committee of the Whole, and then the
aforesaid question shall be again put.]

[41] This rule has been modified so as to specify the questions entitled
to preference. The rule is now as follows:

[When a question is under debate, no motion shall be received but to
adjourn, to lay on the table, to postpone indefinitely, to postpone to a
day certain, to commit, or to amend; which several motions shall have
precedence in the order they stand arranged, and the motion for
adjournment shall always be in order, and be decided without debate.]

[42] RULE 13. In filling up blanks, the largest sum and longest time
shall be first put.

[43] In the case of a division of the question, and a decision against
striking out, I advance doubtingly the opinion here expressed. I find no
authority either way, and I know it may be viewed under a different
aspect. It may be thought that, having decided separately not to strike
out the passage, the same question for striking out cannot be put over
again, though with a view to a different insertion. Still I think it
more reasonable and convenient to consider the striking out and
insertion as forming one proposition; but should readily yield to any
evidence that the contrary is the practice in Parliament.

[44] Noes. 9 Grey, 365.

[45] The rule now fixes a limitation.

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
