Seattle Car & Foundry Co.

FOUNDED 1905

The Seattle Car & Foundry Company was started in 1905 by a few Seattle
business men who had faith in the ability of the Pacific Coast to
support a home industry of this nature. A steady growth both in scope
and quantity of business has confirmed their judgment. Today the
Seattle Car & Foundry Company not only competes on an equal footing
with the east for the trade of the Pacific, but has extended its
field successfully into Alaska, British Columbia, China and all other
sections of the Orient. In its commodious, modern and efficient plant
it designs and builds Flat Cars, Box Cars, Logging Cars, Logging
Trucks, Air-Equipped Connected Trucks, Logging Bunks and Chocks,
Gondola Cars, Refrigerator Cars, Plantation Cars and Cane Cars, Caboose
Cars, Camp Cars, Industrial Cars, Contractors Dump Cars, Push Cars,
Quarry Cars, Track Construction Cars, Tram Cars.

The Leading Car Shops of the Pacific Coast

At the present time the works of the Seattle Car & Foundry Co.
constitutes the largest and best equipped plant on the Pacific Coast
for the manufacture of cars, trucks and contractor's equipment, with
which is affiliated a rolling mill, providing us ample material under
most favorable conditions.

While the shops are perhaps not so extensive as those of some of our
Eastern and European competitors, they are capable of turning out work
in sufficient quantities and of a quality to enable us to successfully
bid on orders of any proportions.

We have been able to satisfy the most rigid requirements of such
trans-continental railroads as the Northern Pacific, Southern Pacific,
Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, and the Harriman system, such electric
companies as Stone & Webster, the British Columbia Electric Railway
and the Portland Light & Power Company, not to mention successful
competition in the Orient with the leading firms of Europe.

But in spite of this success we never lose sight of the fact that this
plant was started primarily for the better service of the Pacific
Coast--particularly of the Pacific Coast logging trade. In this field
we claim a special fitness which has been proven, by the growth of
our business, in a few years, from a very humble beginning into an
organization of considerable industrial significance.

But whether you buy cars, trucks, forgings, castings, contractors,
bridge building or mining equipment, we are in a position to give you
better delivery than the East, greater capacity than any other coast
shops of the same character, and prices that are most reasonable for
the service rendered. Our sales and engineering department are at your
disposal.

You will get satisfaction in dealing with us. Three quarters of our new
business this year was from old customers. Why not get acquainted with
them and us? Write them or us.

Details of Air-Equipped Connected Truck

(CAPACITY 80,000 POUNDS, ALLOWABLE OVERLOAD 10%)

This car was designed with the object of providing heavy capacity
Trucks with Air-Brakes, and at the same time reducing the dead weight
and maintenance to a minimum. This has become a recognized Standard
Logging Car, and as the design permits of considerable latitude in
length of car and centers of bunks, we do not hesitate to recommend it
to anyone who requires either Flat Cars or Trucks for strictly logging
purposes. The convenience of operation as compared with other types of
equipment is apparent. From an economic standpoint the comparison is
even greater. Some of the advantages are given below in detail:

1st. SIMPLICITY. Few parts to get out of repair, consequently car is
always in commission.

2nd. REDUCED COST. First cost is 18% less than Flat Car of same
capacity and equipment.

3rd. SMALL COST OF MAINTENANCE. More than 50% less than Flat Car.

4th. SAFETY OF OPERATION. Greatly increased over detached Trucks on
account of Air Equipment and rigidity of connection, and over Flat Car
in loading and unloading on account of skeleton construction.

5th. REFUSE NOT CARRIED TO DUMP. No deck to accumulate rubbish,
adding to dead weight of car, and carrying it to the dump where it is
discharged, often necessitating dredging to secure necessary depth of
water.

6th. REDUCED DEAD HAUL. Which is 30% less than Flat Car of same
capacity and equipment. This is important where heavy grades are
encountered.

7th. OPEN DESIGN. Facilitates operation of both loading and unloading,
lessening the time required and reducing the danger. At the same time,
ample protection is provided for Brake Rigging, eliminating danger of
being fouled by falling logs.

8th. INCREASED BUFFING CAPACITY. Connecting timbers forming backbone
of 300 sq. in. cross section, which offers great resistance to buffing
shocks.

Length over timber, 40 feet, can be furnished up to 56 feet. Length
over all, 42 feet. Width over connecting timbers, 30 inches.
Height to center of Coupler, 2 feet, 10 inches. Height to top
of Bunk, 48 inches. Width of Bunk, optional, 9 feet or 10 feet.
Bunk centers in illustration, 24 feet, but is optional with
purchaser. M. C. B. Automatic Couplers. Westinghouse Air Brakes.
Inside Hung Metal Brake Beams. Standard Diamond Arch Bar Truck
Frame. Metal Truck Bolster. Seattle Car Manufacturing Co.'s
Patent Cast Steel Body Bolster in combination with Patent Cast
Steel Bunks, riveted together, making solid section. Thirty-three
inch Cast Iron Wheels, chilled tread, double plate. Steel Axles,
4½ × 8 inch Journals. Malleable Iron and Steel Castings used
throughout. Draft Gear optional. (Twin Spring or tandem.) Bunks
Cast Steel, Hercules Patent, equipped with Knight Patent Chock,
the McLafferty Stake, or the Skookum Bunk. Weight, approximately
19,000 pounds. This Car is protected by U. S. Patents.

no part of the load is carried on the timber sills.

Kerriston, Wash., July 19, 1913

Mr. F. W. Chriswell, Chief Engineer,
Seattle Car & Foundry Co.,
Seattle, Washington

Dear Sir:

Mr. Horton our Secretary has requested me to write you of our
experience with the connected logging trucks which we have been
using for the last three or four years.

In a general way I might classify this under two heads,
construction and operation. Regards to construction of these cars
will say, while they are seemingly light, we have found them very
strong, and more serviceable in our logging than flat cars which
we had previously used and are still using. The air equipment
as arranged in these cars is very well protected, and we have
experienced practically no trouble whatsoever from breakage. Due
to the construction of these cars with their three sills as the
only woodwork, we have found the cost of maintenance very little,
perhaps due to a certain extent to the accessibility of the parts,
which permit of a thorough inspection by simply walking past the
car. In operating, we have found these cars exceptionally adapted
to the hauling of logs, and during our four years experience do not
recall an instance where the load has been spilled due to any fault
of the bunk or blocks. Our cars, of which we have twenty-four in
operation, are built on twenty-four foot truck centers with nine
and ten foot bunks, and during the last year and a half we have
lost but one log except through derailment. We find that these cars
seemingly ride easier than the seven flat cars which we have in
service, permit of a larger load and carry their loads to better
advantage. These cars are easily loaded, and it is not uncommon
that we haul nine and ten thousand feet to the car. Our loads will
average between seven and eight thousand feet per car. All of the
trainmen who have worked on these cars, and the loaders in the
woods like them very much. The fact that they are easy to load
leads the loaders to put on a good load on them and in a careful
manner, and in an all around way will consider them very much
superior to the flat cars we are using, being seven in number of
the standard logging type.

Any further information which I may be able to give you and which
you may desire, will be furnished with pleasure upon request.

Very truly yours,
GEO. N. PECK,
General Superintendent

Mr. O. D. Colvin,
Vice Pres. & Mgr. Seattle Car Mfg. Co.,

Seattle, Wash.

Dear Sir

Your Hercules logging trucks are the best car for heavy logging
that I have seen and we are now buying no other. My experience
dates back twenty-five years and I am familiar with the old N.P.
trucks and G.N. trucks which when put out in '93 were the best
trucks made, and also the trucks manufactured in Tacoma, Seattle
and by ourselves. We have had them all more or less in our trains
for the last ten years and have opportunities to observe them under
all classes of service. We have had less repairs and less trouble
on account of hot boxes with your cars than any others. Our cars
are all equipped with the Knight chock block which we find very
effective and safe.

Yours truly,
LAKE WHATCOM LOGGING COMPANY.

"Skookum Chief"

(100,000 POUNDS CAPACITY. STRONGEST LOGGING TRUCK EVER BUILT.)

[Illustration: Deep-Throat Punch]

The Skookum Chief, One-Piece Cast Steel Truck Frame is a radical
departure from the old and well known designs and is a distinct step
forward. The cast steel frame in locomotive tender construction and
passenger car trucks has been widely used and is in favor. The use
of cast steel has many advantages. The most economic distribution of
metal is made possible, and greatest strength with least weight is
the result. In a built-up frame there is always some weak point which
is usually where the parts are bolted together. Bolts become loose
and nuts are lost. A comparison of the Skookum Chief with any other
truck cannot fail to show clearly its advantages in this respect. The
Side Frame, End Frame, Draft Beams and Bolster being in ONE PIECE
eliminates possibility of weakness where these parts are usually
joined by bolts, and the sections of the various parts are so well
proportioned that nothing short of a serious wreck could cause failure.
The repairman would be almost unnecessary and the Truck would always be
in commission, making it possible to handle the business of a camp with
one or two sets of trucks less.

Equipment of Skookum Chief

Bunks--Hercules Cast Steel, either 9 or 10 feet.

Chocks--"Knight," "McLafferty," or "Skookum"

All-Steel "Snohomish" Type Logging Truck

(100,000 POUNDS CAPACITY)

To meet the demand for Trucks of heavier capacity, we are building
All-Steel Trucks, which are fully illustrated in the cuts. This design
is the result of a careful study of the prevailing practice in the
large and up-to-date camps of the Northwest, with the aim of combining
simplicity and strength with a minimum dead load. This Truck has been
altered slightly to include all the latest improvements in logging
truck construction, and was awarded the Grand Prize at the A. Y. P.
Exposition.

Wheels, 33-inch Chilled Cast Iron, fitted on M. C. B. Standard
Axles with 9 × 5-inch Journals. Automatic Couplers and
Twin-Spring Draft Gear with M. C. B. Double-Coil Draft Spring.
If desired, Link and Pin Drawbars can be substituted, as our
pattern is interchangeable with Automatic Coupler. Journal Boxes
are M. C. B. Standard. Bolster Steel Channels reinforced with
Steel Cover Plates top and bottom. Draft Sills Steel Channels
with Malleable Iron Draft Lugs riveted to same. Bolster and Draft
Sills are securely tied together and braced with Steel Plates.
Truck Frame of extra heavy Iron Bars, braced at corners with
Gusset Plates, making it impossible for the frame to get out of
square. Bunks, Hercules Patent with Knight Patent Chock. Bunks
are equipped with metal brace as shown in illustration. Castings
are of either Steel or Malleable Iron. Brake Shoes are applied
to all Wheels and Brake Beams, either inside or outside hung, at
purchaser's option. Brake Shaft can be furnished to operate with
lever at end or wheel at side. Weight of 100,000-pound capacity

"Snohomish" Logging Truck

[Illustration: Universal Milling Machine]

This illustrates our 80,000-pound capacity Snohomish Truck, with all
Metal Frame and Bolster, but with Fir Draft Timbers. This truck is
designed to couple with standard equipment, with a height of 2 feet, 10
inches to center of coupler and 4 feet, 0 inches to top of bunk. The
Bolster is built up of two heavy Steel Channels reinforced with steel
cover plates top and bottom securely riveted to channels. The Truck is
equipped with Hercules Bunk and Knight Chock and is also fitted with
Metal Bunk Brace.

The same general remarks apply to this truck as to Snohomish Truck No.
123. The frame is of heavy iron bars and the fir draft timbers have a
sectional area of 144 square inches, which offers great resistance to
buffing shocks.

Weight per set trucks, of 20,400 pounds.

=Without Chock Blocks=

[Illustration]

"Snohomish" Logging Truck

This truck is especially adapted to use on Logging Railroads, where an
uneven track demands a flexible running gear and an extremely strong
frame. These requirements are carried out in this design by placing
the springs over the Journal Boxes and making the frame of extra heavy
Iron Bars. The simplicity of the design also appeals to the operators,
making it necessary to carry but few extra parts for repairs.

[Illustration: Arch Bar Gang]

Bunk shown is made of straight grain Red Fir, reinforced with
special heavy 12-inch I-Beam closely fitted on timber, but we
recommend our Hercules Patent Bunk equipped with Knight Patent
Chock, McLafferty Stake or Skookum Chock.

Either Automatic Couplers or Link and Pin Drawbars may be used, as
our Link and Pin Drawbar is designed to be interchangeable with
Automatic Coupler, the change being easily made at any time.
Bolsters extra heavy Red Fir, strongly trussed. Draft Timbers,
Red Fir. Draft Gear M. C. B. Standard with M. C. B. double coil
Draft Springs. Truck springs, 70,000 lbs. capacity, heavy double

8 inch Journals. Cast Iron Journal Boxes with self-closing lids.
Cast Iron Columns of heavy pattern. Brake Shoes applied to all
wheels with hand wheel at side. Any style of Brake Shaft can be
furnished.

When required the Truck is decked over between wheels and draft
timbers and extending from end to end.

Length over all, 12 feet. Weight approximately, 18,000 pounds per
set.

"Rainier" Logging Truck

We are the first builders of Logging Equipment to depart from the
practice of the last twenty years and produce a Logging Truck designed
along practical and economic lines. Modern railroading has developed
the "Cast Steel" Engine Frame, Tender Frame and Passenger Truck Frame.
Wherever safety is required together with lightness and durability,
Cast Steel has been introduced.

Following this modern plan we have constructed the "Rainier" All Cast
Steel Truck of eight pieces where ordinarily several hundred are used.

Each Side Frame is in one piece taking the place of Top Arch Bar,
Inverted Arch Bar, Tie Bar, Heel Brace, Truck Columns, and the many
Bolts used to hold these parts together.

Each End Frame is in one piece taking the place of Top End Bar, Bottom
End Bar, Striking Plate, Carry Iron, Corner Gussets, Brake Staff
Brackets, and the numerous Bolts necessary to tie these parts together.

The Draft Beams are each in one piece, taking the place of Draft
Timber, Draft Lugs, and the Bolts required to anchor them.

The use of Cast Steel permits of the most economic distribution of
the metal, and the "Rainier" Truck is an example of what can be
accomplished.

The Bolster and Bunk are similar to those used in the Hercules Trucks.

Springs are located under the Bolster to absorb shocks which would
otherwise be transferred directly to the Truck Frame. The Springs over
the Journal Boxes provide additional protection from shocks and also
permit the wheels to hold the rails on an uneven track or at low joints.

Brake Beams are hung between the wheels and kept high enough to protect
them in case of derailment.

The equipment includes Automatic Couplers to Couple with Standard
Equipment, 33 inches above rail, and 33 inch Chilled Cast Iron Wheels
fitted on Steel Axles with 5 × 9 inch Journals.

Journal Boxes are Malleable Iron. No Cast Iron is used with the
exception of Brake Shoes.

The Center Bearing of the Bunk and Bolster is so constructed that the
Bunk cannot turn over under load when train is started or stopped
suddenly, as the Bunk cannot be removed from the Truck until it is
turned parallel to the Draft Beams. The "Rainier" Truck stands for
safety first.

All-Steel, Improved, "Rainier" Truck

This truck is similar to the one shown on the preceding page. It
differs only in having the side frames cast in one piece, thus reducing
the number of parts and increasing the strength of the truck, a
practice originated by us, on logging trucks and which is being widely
adapted by leading railroads on standard equipment.

This truck is designed for extreme conditions where the timber is very
large and is taken out in long lengths and where load at times will
total from 40 to 60 tons.

From the fact that Cast Steel is substituted for structural design the
expense of repair parts is practically eliminated while the factor of
safety is sufficient to meet all demands unless cars meet with a wreck.

Attention is called to the method of holding the bunk in place by means
of a bunk bracket which clamps in position on the half turn. The bunk
is prevented from slipping out of position by Bunk Stops which can be
seen on the side frames.

This truck is designed for extreme strength and rigidity. It is certain
to become one of our most popular types. Both structurally and in
appearance it is a high-grade product.

"Red River" Type Skeleton Logging Car

Quadruple Bunks

80,000 CAPACITY. 40 FEET LONG. WEIGHT COMPLETELY EQUIPPED 12 TONS.

The efficiency of this car is a simple mathematical problem. Compare
this 4-Bunk Car with a Flat Car with four bunks of the same capacity
and note the saving. The percentage of dead weight to log capacity is
30% as compared to 36¼% for the flat car or a car cost per thousand
feet logs of $78.50 as compared to $93.50 for flat car. This means a
saving of 20% on the haul back of empty cars and nearly 20% in first
cost.

Where a large percentage of logs from 12 to 20 feet are handled, this
Quadruple Bunk car has a great advantage over any other type. The
construction is such that the entire load can be carried safely on the
two center Bunks. Logs in length from 12 to 41 feet can be carried with
equal facility.

Details are as follows:

Westinghouse Air Brake, Automatic Couplers, Tandem Spring Draft Rig,
Two Main Sills 10 × 10 in., forty feet.

The Bunks are arranged to dump the load on either side.

Two Side Sills 10 × 10 in. extending from Bolster to Bolster. Each
Side Sill is trussed with two 1½ in. rods. Two intermediate bunks are
located directly over cross ties. Bunks are 10 feet long equipped with
Knight chocks.

Bolsters are built up of Structural and Cast Steel of ample capacity to
carry load.

Trucks are Standard Arch Bar type with 4½ × 8 in. Journals. 33 inch
chilled tread double-plate, Griffin wheels. Structural Steel Bolsters
and spring plank. All metal Brake Beams inside hung.

This car is equipped with all necessary steps and handles and meets
the requirements of the Inter-State Commerce Commission and the U. S.
safety appliance laws.

Quadruple Bunks

80,000 CAPACITY. 40 FEET LONG. WEIGHT FULLY EQUIPPED 12¼ TONS.

This car is similar in construction to the Red River Car shown on
preceding page and differs only in two important details, the first
point of difference being the Bunks. These Bunks are built up of
Structural Steel and are equipped with trip stakes. The stakes are
released or tripped from the safety side of car. The other difference
is that there is a 10 × 10 in. center sill between the two main sills
which extends from draft rig to draft rig.

Where short length logs are handled four bunks must be provided in
order to permit of thirty and forty ton loads. This car meets these
conditions perfectly. Small cars of twenty and twenty-five ton capacity
are not heavy enough for economical and careful handling in heavy
trains.

The same efficiency applies in the handling of logs as compared with
standard flat cars as the percentage shown on opposite page.

For details see the description of the "Red River" car on the opposite

[Illustration: (SECTIONAL VIEW)]

"Rainier" Bunk

This is a Cast Steel Bunk equipped with Cast Steel Chocks held in
upright position by means of a lock together with a locking bar
extending to the opposite end of Bunk. This bar, instead of being in
direct compression as is the case of other Bunks of this type, has the
compression stress reduced two thirds by means of the lock. The chock
when once tripped can not rebound into position and lock which is a
frequent occurrence in certain Bunks now on the market.

=This bunk is absolutely Fool-Proof.=

* * * * *

[Illustration: (END VIEW)]

The reduction of the strain on the compression rods completely
eliminates all possibility of buckling or binding, while the positive
locking device does away completely with all danger of bad spills from
falling logs.

The "Rainier" Bunk is made of high grade Cast Steel and is a picture
of massive strength. It is as positive in its operation and as simply
perfect in its mechanical construction as the automatic coupler. It
facilitates and expedites the handling of logs, assuring a saving of at
least ten cents a thousand and eliminates all possibility of danger to
the operator.

Hercules Patent Double Eye Beam Logging Bunk and Knight Patent Chock

Can be applied to any type of Logging Truck or Flat Car. Indestructible
in service. No repairs. Weight approximately 1300 lbs.

The Chock Block attachment is simple in construction, easily adjusted
and quick and positive in operation.

When Chock Blocks are in position against logs and grab hook applied,
the load is secure.

[Illustration: Steam Hammer]

To unload, the grab hook is removed and the movement of the log slides
chock block over end of bunk as illustrated in figure. The chock block
on opposite end is readily adjusted to the position desired.

The men are never required to get on the unloading side of car. In flat
car service the cost of all wooden stakes and blocks is eliminated, a
saving alone in one year more than the cost of the Hercules Bunks.

Flat Cars can be unloaded in a fraction of the time, with absolutely no
danger to employees, and the strain on car body reduced to a minimum,
thereby increasing the life of the car.

When applied to flat cars a steel channel is substituted for the I-beam.

It is especially adapted for use on our Connected Trucks, and patents
have been granted covering its application to this class of car.

Skookum Bunk

With Our Original Non-Collapsible Frame

(PATENTED)

This Bunk provides the desirable combination of a Cast Steel Body with
a disappearing Chock secured by a _Tension_ Locking Bar. Practical
experiment and engineering skill have developed this Bunk to provide
"Safety First" in handling the minimum load as prescribed by the
railways. Where an adjustable Chock is not required the "Skookum" will
prove its superiority on account of its Cast Steel Body, which is
similar to our well known Hercules Cast Steel Bunk. It has also the
upward projecting flanges to prevent the shifting of the load, and the
hollow channel for the protection of the locking mechanism. This type
has been copied by designers of all modern Bunks since our first model
was introduced five years ago, and this fact is evidence of the merit
of the design.

The offset foot of the upright leg of the Chock resting upon the
sloping floor of the Bunk makes it easily held in position but
impossible to prevent its disappearing when released. Unlocking the
Chock is simple and easy and there are no sliding surfaces to wear
away. The locking bar is held by a center crank and locks on the dead
center. The recess in the heel of the Chock engages the T-head of the
locking bar and makes a positive lock. The Chock locks automatically
when brought to position. The locking bar is provided with a take-up to
provide a means of overcoming trouble incident to wear or stretch of
the parts, and always maintain a perfect adjustment.

are let down the incline by means of 1½ in. wire rope, attached to a
donkey engine.

This car was designed to meet these conditions, and is provided with a
steel backbone, reinforced at the ends forward of bolsters to provide
for the extreme angle of cable pull from a horizontal line and at the
down hill end to support the bulkhead, which is provided to keep the
logs from shifting. The vertical bulkhead posts are riveted to the
steel backbone. At the cable end a special combination buffer and cable
casting of cast steel is secured to the backbone by means of gusset
plates, and is also riveted to end sill.

The backbone is built up of steel plates and angles in the form of
a box girder, of the fish belly type. Cross bearers are located
intermediate of the bolsters, and are sufficiently strong to carry
the loads from the side sills to the center construction. Experience
has proved that for logging cars, steel is unsuited for use in side
sills, as continual shocks, resulting from discharging the load, cause
their failure. For this reason red fir side sills were introduced in
this car, making the underframe a composite construction of steel
and timber. The side sills being supported at four points, viz.: at
bolsters and cross bearers, no trouble has been experienced from
failure of these sills. In case of failure, they are readily replaced,
and the work can readily be done at any camp.

The bulkhead is constructed with a steel frame, with planking for the
bulkhead proper, so that in case blocking is necessary to fill out
between the log and the Bulkhead, this blocking can be nailed to the
bulkhead to secure it in place, the object being to provide against the
possibility of the log starting to shift.

The cable casting is made with a machine-fit pin to engage the shackle
on the cable and place the pin in positive shear.

The cars were equipped with four Hercules Bunks, to provide for short
or long logs.

The trucks are of the Diamond Arch Bar type, with cast steel bolsters.
The bolsters are of special design, with hemispherical center bearing,
to take care of the rock of the trucks in passing over the sharp,
vertical curves.

Axles with 4¼×8 in. journals, and 33 in. chilled cast iron wheels are
used.

Cars are equipped with Westinghouse automatic air brakes and inside
hung metal brake beams.

The draft rig is of the twin spring type, with automatic couplers.

The interior of this car is arranged to accommodate halves of beef
of the largest size suspended from trolleys on a track, and have
ample clearance to keep the neck of the beef from the floor. There
are three tracks extending the length of the car with switches at the
door to direct the beef to any track desired. Between the tracks at
each carline are cross hooks provided on which mutton may be hung.
The tracks are arranged so that the beef may be handled by trolley
directly from the cooling room into the car and left suspended in the
car to be unloaded by trolley at destination. The economy of this
specially designed car will appeal to the packer who ships from the
Abattoir to various distributing centers. Provision is made to prevent
the load from swinging which adds to the safety in transit. Ice boxes
are arranged at ends with provision for ventilation and complete
refrigeration. The thorough manner of insulation and ventilation makes
it possible to reduce the capacity of ice boxes to a minimum, thereby
reducing the cost of icing and at the same time increasing the space
for loading.

For several years the necessity of providing economical, sanitary and
convenient commissary and living accommodations for the employes of
Lumber Camps has induced us to investigate fully the best equipment
now in use for that purpose and has enabled us to design equipment of
Portable Camp Trains to meet the requirements of individual operators.

[Illustration: Detail Showing Seating Capacity of Camp Diner]

These Portable Camps are being introduced and installed in nearly all
large lumbering and railroad operations as they not only prevent many
serious losses heretofore sustained by the destruction by fire of camp
outfits but at the same time make it possible to keep the workmen's
headquarters close to the work, thereby greatly increasing their
physical efficiency.

All Steel 1 1-2 Yard Two-Way Side Dump Car

This dump car is particularly adapted for use in quarries in connection
with lime or cement works, where a light easy running car is required.
The body and truck frame is unusually rigid for a small capacity car,
which adds much to its life. The body of the car is built of steel
plate strongly braced with steel angles and the top rocker bearing is a
steel casting. The bottom bearing is a forged jaw with a square shank
which sets into a recess in the truck frame in such a manner that it
cannot raise in dumping, but the body may be lifted from the trucks
without removing any bolts or keys. The object of this construction is
that the body will become separated from the truck in case the car is
derailed and rolls down an embankment permitting the two parts to be
handled with little difficulty. The angle of dump is ample to clear
the load and the door is free to swing permitting a free discharge of
the load without bringing any shock upon the door, which in the case
of the door being held in a fixed position often causes an upset car
and the consequent disabling of the car. The door closes and locks
automatically as the body is righted. The truck frame is built of steel
I-beams and channels and the drawhead is a heavy forging and fitted
with draft springs. One man may easily dump the loaded car and bring
the body back into position. The wheels are 16-inch chilled cast iron.

Three Yard Automatic Dump Car

The illustrations shown herewith are taken from actual operations on
the Lake Washington canal. They show the car just prior to coming in
contact with the release block, which is located between the rails.
This block trips a lever and upsets the car by means of guide bars that
automatically tilt it to the side and raise the corresponding side
shutter allowing the load to discharge quickly and freely as shown in
Figure 2.

[Illustration: _Fig. 2._ Car Just After Engaging Trip Block]

The car is restored to the upright position by means of a similar block
located outside the rail which comes in contact with the guide just
at the desired point and throws the car back into place where it is
securely locked until ready to be dumped again.

The simplicity and efficiency of this device are self evident. It is

Some Facts About Railroad Building

Curves

The simplest way of designating a railroad curve is by giving the
length of the radius--_i. e._, the distance from the center to the
outside of the circle, or one-half the diameter. The shorter the radius
the sharper the curve. The length of the radius is usually stated in
feet; but English engineers often state the radius in chains (one chain
= 66 feet). The length of the radius of a railroad curve is measured to
the center of the track.

Civil engineers designate railway curves by degrees (using the sign °
for degrees and " for minutes, there being 60 minutes in one degree).
The sharpness of the curve is determined by the "degree of curve," or
the number of degrees of the central angle subtended by a chord of
100 feet. Or, in other words, let two lines start from the center of
a circle in the shape of a V, so that the angle at the point of the V
is one degree (equivalent to 1/360 of a complete circle), then, if the
two sides of the V are prolonged until they are 100 feet apart, any
part of a circle made by using one of these lines for its radius is a
"one-degree curve." The exact length of radius which with an angle of
one degree has a chord of 100 feet is found to be 5,729.65 feet. For
sake of convenience 5,730 feet is usually taken as the radius of a
one-degree curve. If the angle at the point of the V is two degrees and
the sides are prolonged until 100 feet apart, the length of each side
is (almost exactly) one-half as long as when the angle is one degree,
or one-half of 5,730==2,865 feet. For a three-degree curve the radius
is one-third of 5,730; for a four-degree curve one-fourth of 5,730; and
so on. For perfect exactness the length of 100 feet should be measured
not along a straight line connecting the ends of the V, but along the
line of the circle of which the sides of the V are radii--_i. e._,
the arc should be used and not the chord. The difference, however, is
so slight for any curves ordinarily used on main lines of standard
gauge railroad as to be ignored in practice. But for extremely sharp
curves, such as our locomotives both wide and narrow gauge are built
for, a considerable mathematical error would be involved by the use of
100-foot chords and calculating the length of the radius by dividing
5,730 by the degree of curve. The ratio of this error increases with
the degree of curve, since the error is caused by neglecting the
difference between the length of the chord and of the arc (_e. g._,
a 60-degree curve and 100-foot chord mathematically compels 100-feet
radius instead of 95½ feet; a 90-degree curve and 100-foot chord,
71+feet radius instead of 63.6 feet).

In practice, however, the formula of dividing 5,730 by the degree of
curve (R==5730/D) is almost universally used, and the mathematical
error is avoided by using two 50-foot chords for curves ranging from 10
to 16 degrees, and four 25-foot chords for curves ranging from 17 to 30
degrees, and further sub-dividing for sharper curves, since this almost
exactly balances the error, and it is also a practical necessity in
laying out sharp curves to use short chords.

For extremely sharp curves, or say 100 feet radius or less, it is usual
to express the curve by feet radius rather than by degrees. The table
following is computed by the formula R==5730/D, and fractions of feet
are not taken into account.

NOTE--The above engineers' method of designating the rate of
curvature of a railway curve must not be confounded with the number
of degrees of a circle occupied by the curved portion of the track;
thus a curved track making a quarter turn, equivalent to a right
angle, will always be 90 degrees of a circle (360 degrees--the
whole circle) no matter whether the curve is an easy one with a
long radius or a sharp one with a short radius.

Rule for Measuring the Radius of a Sharp Curve

[Illustration]

Stretch a string, say 20 feet long, or longer if the curve is not a
sharp one, across the curve corresponding to the line from A to C in
the diagram. Then measure from B, the center of the line A C, and at
right angles with it, to the rail at D.

Multiply the distance A to B, or one-half the length of the string in
inches, by itself; measure the distance D to B in inches, and multiply
it by itself. Add these two products and divide the sum by twice the
distance from B to D, measured exactly in inches and fractional parts
of inches. This will give the radius of the curve in inches.

It may be more convenient to use a straight edge instead of a string.
Care must be taken to have the ends of the string or straight edge
touch the same part of the rail as is taken in measuring the distance
from the center. If the string touches the bottom of the rail flange
at each end, and the center measurement is made to the rail head, the
result will not be correct.

In practice it will be found best to make trials on different parts of
the curve to allow for irregularities. It is best not to measure across
from one end of the curved track to the other even when the curve is
so located that this is possible, since if any portion of the straight
track at either end of the curve is included the result will be
incorrect. This rule does not apply to curves of over one-half circle
if the line is drawn connecting the two ends of the curve. It is a good
plan to make the measurement on the inside of the outer rail of the
curve, as this is often more convenient. In this case one-half of the
width of gauge should be deducted from the radius when calculated, as
the radius of the curve should be measured to the center of the track.

EXAMPLE--Let A C be a 20-foot string; half the distance, or A B, is
then 10 feet, or 120 inches. Suppose B D is found on measurement to
be 3 inches. Then 120 multiplied by 120 is 14,400, and 3 multiplied
by 3 is 9; 14,400 added to 9 is 14,409, which, divided by twice 3,
or 6, equals 2,401½ inches, or 200 feet 1½ inches, which is the
radius of the curve.

A B² plus B D²
The formula is thus stated: -------------- == R.
2 B D

Or applied to the above example,

120² plus 3²
------------ == 2,401½ in. == 200 feet 1½ inches.
