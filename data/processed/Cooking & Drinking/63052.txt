Questions and answers regarding the NEW KNOX CHOICE-OF-FOODS diet:

[Illustration: {uncaptioned}]

Q. IS THIS NEW DIET BASED ON SOUND REDUCING PRINCIPLES YOUR DOCTOR WILL
OK?

[Illustration: {uncaptioned}]

A. _Indeed he will_ ... because the CHOICE-OF-FOODS DIET is based on
sound nutritional principles with which your doctor has had a great deal
of experience. For many years the medical profession has advised the use
of Food Exchange Lists[1] where proper diet is of the utmost importance
to the patient’s very existence ... as in the case of the diabetic.
Naturally, this system of dieting must provide with unfailing accuracy,
the proper amounts of protein, minerals and vitamins essential to good
health at all times.

Now, these carefully and scientifically developed Food Exchanges (or, as
we call them ... CHOICES) have been adjusted to a reducing diet, making
it one that can actually improve your health as well as control your
weight.

Q. IF YOU HAVE TRIED OTHER WAYS OF REDUCING WITHOUT SUCCESS ... WHY WILL
THE CHOICE-OF-FOODS DIET SOLVE YOUR WEIGHT PROBLEM?

[Illustration: {uncaptioned}]

A. _Weight control normally involves just 2 factors_:

the knowledge of a few simple rules of nutrition and your own will power
to carry them out. First of all, there’s no mystery about why you’ve put
on weight. You’ve been eating more food than your body burns up ... so,
this extra food has turned to fat. You _will_ lose extra weight on this
safe, sound diet ... because you’ll be eating fewer calories[2] than
needed and will force your body to use the stored fat. You’ll find the
CHOICE-OF-FOODS DIET is _more_ than a way to get rid of excess weight
right now. It is a basic guide to good eating habits for anyone ... fat
or thin. It will teach you _what foods_ and how much of them to eat to
get slim and _stay_ slim.

Q. IS THIS A MONOTONOUS “SAME FOODS EVERY DAY” DIET ... OR IS IT A
VARIED ONE YOU’LL FIND EASY TO STICK TO?

[Illustration: {uncaptioned}]

A. _The Knox Choice-of-Foods diet offers you a wide variety of good_,
normal _foods_ ... not extreme or faddish ones, from which to prepare
meals you and your family will enjoy. In fact, the only way your family
will know you’re dieting will be when they see you take smaller
portions. A diet that allows you to eat such favorites as steak, baked
potatoes, seafood and delicious desserts is one you’ll find easy to
follow ... even long after you’ve reached your weight goal.

Q. DO YOU HAVE TO SPEND TIME COUNTING CALORIES AND WORRYING ABOUT
BALANCED MEALS?

[Illustration: {uncaptioned}]

A. _No, and this is one good reason why you’ll find it so easy to stay
on the Knox Choice-of-Foods diet._

It does most of the work for you! As you look at the key to this
reducing plan—the CHOICE-OF-FOODS DIET LISTS (shown on pull-out chart
following page 18) you will quickly see that the foods you must eat
classify into 6 simple lists. _The foods in amounts indicated in each of
these lists are nutritional equals._

FOR EXAMPLE:

Under the Meat List you will find seven foods ... each one having the
_same amount of protein, carbohydrate, fat and calories_—

Meat and poultry (Beef, lamb, pork, liver, chicken)
Cold Cuts (Salami, minced ham, Bologna, liverwurst, luncheon loaf)
Frankfurter
Egg
Fish (Haddock, flounder, bass, salmon, tuna, crab, lobster, shrimp,
clams, oysters, sardines)
Cheese (Cheddar type, cottage)
Peanut butter

If yours is the 1200 daily calorie diet ... and calls for 4 of the foods
on the Meat List ... just select _any_ 4 of the foods you wish (in the
quantity indicated) without thinking about calories and you can’t go
wrong. _The calories have already been counted for you when the list was
prepared._

Q. WHY DOES PROTEIN PLAY SUCH AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS DIET?

A. _Because this particular nutrient is a vital key to feeling, looking
and doing your best at all times._ The more science proves about
protein, the more we know of its importance in the daily diet. _Your
body can’t store protein ... you must have a new supply of it every day
to build and renew body tissues._ You can readily see, then, why protein
is so necessary in reducing diets. Without it, body tissues waste away,
muscles sag and pep lags.

Q. HOW SOON WILL YOU SEE RESULTS ON THIS REDUCING DIET?

[Illustration: {uncaptioned}]

A. _You will lose from one to three pounds[3] a week._ However, don’t be
discouraged if you lose slowly at first or if you lose at an irregular
rate. Remember, you gained all these extra pounds over a period of time.
Give yourself time to lose them.

Q. IF YOU GET HUNGRY ... ARE “BETWEEN-MEAL” SNACKS ALLOWED ON THIS DIET?

A. _Yes! Because they not only make dieting more pleasant, they are
necessary!_ Nutritionally, a “between-meal” snack does two things: gives
dieters an “energy lift” needed at late morning and late afternoon.
Also, it dulls the appetite, making the dieter content with less food at
the next meal. Remember, however, these snacks must be kept within your
daily calorie pattern!

Choice-of-Foods diet allows you to have the famous Knox High-Protein
Gelatine Drink 3 times a day.

[Illustration: {uncaptioned}]

(Yes, this is the same concentrated protein drink doctors have
recommended for years ... as a pleasant way to get more protein in the
daily diet of persons whose daily intake of this vital nutrient may be
inadequate.) In the reducing diet, the Knox Drink works 3 ways:

1. It’s a wonderfully refreshing and filling “between-meal” treat
2. It curbs your appetite, so you are satisfied with less food
3. It supplies you with _additional protein, a must_ when you are
taking off excess weight.

Take the Knox High-Protein Drink ½ hour before meals
... _IN EITHER OF THESE APPETIZING WAYS:_

AS A COLD DRINK (WITH FRUIT JUICES)

[Illustration: {uncaptioned}]

Empty 1 envelope Knox Gelatine in ¾ glass of orange juice, other fruit
juices or water, not iced. Let liquid absorb the gelatine. Then stir
briskly. Drink quickly. If it thickens, add more liquid, stir again.

AS A HOT DRINK (WITH BOUILLON)

[Illustration: {uncaptioned}]

Sprinkle 1 envelope Knox Gelatine on ¼ cup cold water to soften. Add 1
bouillon cube and ¾ cup boiling water. Stir until gelatine and bouillon
cube are thoroughly dissolved. ¾ cup of any very hot broth may be used
in place of bouillon.

Also, you’ll find you have a wide choice of delicious, filling Knox
soups, salads and desserts that have so few calories ... _you may have a
serving of any one of them a day and not worry about upsetting your
daily calorie pattern_. Look for these delicious treats in the recipe
section in back of book.

Q. AFTER YOUR WEIGHT GOAL IS REACHED, HOW WILL YOU KEEP YOUR SLENDER,
NEW FIGURE?

A. _The sensible eating habits you form while following the Knox
Choice-of-Foods diet and the Knox “Booster” Drink will help you do
this!_ You will find you’ve lost much of your desire for over-eating.
You’ve seen the dramatic change in your looks and your feelings. You’re
more attractive, feel younger, healthier, happier. Now you want to stay
that way!

With the loss of excess weight, you are now entitled to more calories.
However, always remember, _too many more calories_ will put extra
pounds right back on.

Actually, _you can have about ½ as many more calories as your original
diet plan called for_. For instance, if you were on the 1200 calorie
Knox diet, about 1800 calories is right for you to maintain your new
weight.

As you have already learned on page 8, Protein is the vital key to
feeling and looking your best at all times ... particularly when you are
reducing or _watching your weight_ as you are now doing. The Knox
High-Protein “Booster” Drink[4] made with milk will not only add about
15 grams of useful, body-building Protein to your daily diet, but will
also serve as a healthful curb to your appetite.

[Illustration: {uncaptioned}]

Take the Knox “Booster” Drink (with milk) ½ hour before lunch and
dinner. In an 8 or 10 oz. dry glass, thoroughly mix 1 envelope Knox
Gelatine with 3-6 tablespoons _instant_ non-fat dry milk. (Varies with
brand.) Fill with cold water. Stir briskly until milk thoroughly
dissolves. Drink quickly.

Q. HOW DO YOU GET STARTED ON THE KNOX CHOICE-OF-FOODS DIET?

[Illustration: {uncaptioned}]

A. FIRST, _find your desirable weight on the following chart_; SECOND,
_determine the proper number of calories you need to lose weight_.
HERE’S HOW: Let’s say you are a woman 5′3″ tall and have a medium frame;
according to the table you should weigh 128 lbs. Now multiplying this by
10 you will have the recommended daily calories you should have to lose
weight properly.

128 × 10 = 1280 calories

ALSO NOTE THESE SPECIAL MENU HELPS

1. When a recipe serving is listed as “Free Choice” it means that you
may eat 1 serving without having to count it in your daily diet pattern.

2. Use the milk in your meal plan to drink, in coffee, on cereal, or
with other foods.

3. Serve vegetables plain or with part of the meat or fat choice for
seasoning. You may wish to use together the vegetables, milk, and meat
choices in your meal plan. This way you can make soups, stews, or other
dishes in which you combine several foods.

4. Measure all foods on the Bread List after they have been cooked.

5. Eat the meat or fish prepared for the family as long as no fat or
flour has been added. Meat juices, with the fat removed, may be used
with your meat or vegetables for added flavor.

It is important that you measure meat after it is cooked. Bones and
extra fat should not be counted in the total weight. Cut off extra fat
instead of eating it.

6. When you are on a reducing regime, no matter whether on a 1200, 1600,
or 1800 calorie diet, use only the amount of fat permitted in that diet.
You may use it in any way you prefer—as a spread, for seasoning foods,
in dressing vegetables—but count the fat used in these ways as part of
your total allowance for the day.

It is easier to diet when food looks so appealing that you don’t miss
high-calorie foods or high-calorie extras.

SPECIAL RECIPE HELPS

_It may help you to have a list of some foods that are low in calories._

LOW-CALORIE SWEETENERS

Because each teaspoon of sugar gives 20 calories, you can cut them down
if you use a sweetener that will not supply any calories.

Low-calorie sweeteners mean sweet taste without calories and without
sugar. The recipes in this booklet use saccharin (¼ grain tablets),
Sucaryl (tablets or solution), and Sweeta (solution).

1 tablet saccharin Equaled in sweetness by 1 teaspoon
of sugar
or
1 tablet Sucaryl
or
⅛ tsp. Sucaryl solution
or
2 drops Sweeta

It is unwise to take more than a reasonable amount (equal to about 12
tablets) as the total in the day’s meals.

Liquid non-caloric sweeteners may be added directly to the dissolved
gelatine mixture.

Non-caloric sweetening tablets may be crushed and stirred into the
dissolved gelatine mixture, or they may be dissolved in small amount of
the liquid called for in a recipe, then added.

LOW-CALORIE FOODS

A number of low-calorie canned or bottle fruits, fruit juices, and
beverages are now available in many markets. These foods add much
interest in low-calorie diets.

Low-calorie foods used in recipes in this booklet include:

Canned Fruits, unsweetened
Canned Fruits, non-caloric sweetened
Canned Fruit Juices, unsweetened
Canned Fruit Juices, non-caloric sweetened
Carbonated Beverages, non-caloric sweetened

Skim milk is a low-caloric form of milk which helps with successful
weight loss by keeping calories low while food value remains high. Fluid
skim milk or non-fat dry milk solids can be used.

Non-fat dry milk solids plus water make skim milk. Follow directions on
the package for correct proportions. To reliquefy—measure dry milk into
glass; add 1 cup water and stir. Chill.

STEPS TO SUCCESS WITH KNOX GELATINE RECIPES

To insure satisfactory jelling, the number of grains of Knox Unflavored
Gelatine in each envelope is measured scientifically. Tablespoons vary
in size. An “envelope” of gelatine is always an accurate measure.

To soften gelatine in all cold liquids except milk, sprinkle gelatine
into ½ cup of the cold liquid. Let stand to soften.

To soften gelatine in ½ cup of cold milk, stir the gelatine into the
milk.

To dissolve softened gelatine, stir into hot liquid required in the
recipe, or place over hot water and stir until dissolved.

One envelope of gelatine will gel up to 2 cups of liquid.

When solids are added to 2 cups of a gelatine-liquid mixture, up to 2
cups may be added.

MORE GEL-COOKERY HELPS

Fresh pineapple and frozen must be cooked before adding it to a gelatine
mixture to insure jelling; canned pineapple can be used as it comes from
the can.

When adding solid ingredients, the gelatine mixture is first chilled to
the consistency of cold unbeaten egg white from fresh eggs. This
prevents the solids from rising to the top or sinking to the bottom of
the mold.

To chill the gelatine mixture quickly to the consistency of unbeaten egg
white, half fill the lower part of a double boiler with ice and water.
Set upper part of double boiler containing the gelatine-liquid mixture
over the ice. Stir frequently until it is a smooth, evenly chilled,
unbeaten egg white consistency. As an alternative, two bowls may be used
instead of the double boiler.

When low-calorie sweeteners are used in the recipe, beat the egg whites
stiff but not dry, then fold them in as directed.

If sugar is used in the recipe when beaten egg whites are added to the
gelatine, beat a part of it into the egg whites as in meringues.

HOW TO MOLD AND UNMOLD KNOX GELATINE DISHES

Jellied foods—soups, main dishes, salads, or desserts—can be molded in
square, round, or loaf pans, muffin tins, washed tins from canned foods,
bowls, cups, glasses, or paper drinking cups. For easy serving, a
gelatine mixture may be chilled in serving dishes that will go directly
to the table, or it may be spooned from bowls into serving dishes.

To unmold, dip the mold in warm or hot water to the depth of the
gelatine—metal molds in warm water, glass molds in hot water. Loosen
edge with the tip of a paring knife. Place the serving dish on top of
the mold, the two tightly together, and turn upside down. Shake, holding
the serving dish tightly to the mold. Carefully lift off the mold.
Gelatine may be unmolded at serving time, or even as long as an hour or
so before mealtime if the service plate or platter is put back in the
refrigerator.
