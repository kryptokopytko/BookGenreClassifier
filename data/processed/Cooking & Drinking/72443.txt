_Dear Friend_:

Here is our _newest_ and _fullest_ collection of cooky recipes ...
our answer to thousands of requests from homemakers who have learned
that _everybody loves cookies_! We give you many hints, shortcuts,
and tricks that save you time and work ... everything that will make
cooky-baking _so_ easy for you.

In this book you’ll find _every type_ of cooky—all the favorites our
Staff has discovered in our years of testing in the General Mills
kitchens. Testing, of course ... testing and re-testing ... is the
real “success secret” behind all our recipes. Why, we often spend
_weeks_ testing and perfecting just one single recipe! We make the
recipe over and over again, but each time some _one_ change is made
that the Staff feels might improve it. In addition, we try out any
suggestions from our homemaker-testers. Finally, when we’re positive
we’ve got the best possible recipe, we release that recipe to you.

Now before you start to bake, be sure you look at the “how-to-do”
pages immediately following. But you’ll find good help on _every_
page—for we have included _all_ the little secrets for success that
we have been gathering for years! If you follow these suggestions and
our simplified and exact recipes, we know you’ll agree with us that
_cooky-making is fun_!

We are so proud of our five new kitchens! The Terrace Kitchen,
pictured above, is used for general recipe testing and also for the
preparation of luncheons to be served to special guests in our Early
American Dining Room.

We also have a Kamera Kitchen for preparing foods for photography; a
striking Polka Dot Kitchen for appliance testing; Tomorrow’s Kitchen
for testing new food products and baking methods; and a Products
Control Kitchen for the baking tests on our flours, quick mixes,
etc. You’ll love our Tasting Bar, where we give recipes critical
“taste-tests” to be sure they are perfect!

Don’t forget—if you are ever in Minneapolis, you will find a most
warm welcome here!

_How to Get PERFECT Results from Recipes in this Book_....

[Illustration:
=1 Read Recipe Carefully!= Every word of it. And do be _sure_ to
see if there’s anything to be done before you start mixing ... like
chopping nuts or melting chocolate.]

[Illustration:
=2 Look at the Pictures!= They give you “know how” you need for
every step.]

[Illustration:
=3 Turn on the Heat!= If the cookies are to be baked immediately
after mixing, see that the oven is heated to correct temperature.]

[Illustration:
=4 Get Your Ingredients Together!= Saves time and steps to have
them all in one place.]

[Illustration:

=5 Collect Utensils, Too!= Gather together all you’ll need ... from
the flour sifter to the baking pan.]

[Illustration:
=6 Measure as Exactly as a Druggist= follows a doctor’s
prescription! Two minutes spent measuring carefully may save you
hours of grief.]

_Cooking success is up to you!
If you’ll take pains to measure true,
Use Standard cups and spoons all the way.
And then level off—it’ll always pay!_

[Illustration:
Use squares of paper when sifting, measuring, etc.]

[Illustration:
Use straight-edged knife for “leveling off.”]

[Illustration:
=Dry Measuring Cup= has no rim ... 1-cup line is even with top.

Use for any dry ingredients or shortening.]

[Illustration:
=Liquid Measuring Cup= ... has rim above the 1-cup line.

Use for measuring any liquid ingredients.]

[Illustration:
=Graduated Measuring Cups= ... ¼, ⅓, ½, 1 cup.

Use for part-cups of any dry ingredients or shortenings.]

[Illustration:
=Measuring Spoons= ... ¼, ½, and 1 teaspoon, 1 tablespoon.

Use for less than ¼ cup of any ingredient.]

HERE’S HOW WE MEASURE

[Illustration: FLOUR

=1= Sift flour through large open sifter (to aerate it) onto square
of paper before measuring.]

[Illustration:
=2= Then spoon sifted flour lightly into a “dry” measuring cup ...
heaping it up.]

[Illustration:
=3= Level off cup with straight-edged knife. Don’t shake cup. This
is important!]

[Illustration: SUGAR

=1= =White Granulated Sugar= needs sifting only if lumpy.
Spoon lightly into “dry” measuring cup. Level it off with a
straight-edged knife. Don’t knock or tap cup.]

[Illustration:
=2= =Brown Sugar.= If it’s lumpy, press through coarse sieve; or
heat in slow oven; or crush lumps with rolling pin. Pack into “dry”
measuring cup just enough to hold its shape. Level off.]

[Illustration:
=3= =Confectioners’ Sugar.= Press through sieve to remove
lumps. Spoon lightly into “dry” measuring cup. Level off with
straight-edged knife. Don’t shake cup.]

=Baking Powder=, =Soda=, =Salt=, =Cornstarch=, =Cream of Tartar=,
=Spices=, =Etc.=

[Illustration:
Fill measuring spoon. Level off with straight-edged knife.]

[Illustration: SHORTENING

Use Graduated Measuring Cups. Have shortening at room temperature.
Pack shortening firmly into measuring cup. Level off with
straight-edged knife. In measuring less than ¼ cup, use a
tablespoon.]

[Illustration: LIQUIDS

Use “liquid” measuring cup to prevent spilling. Pour liquid into
cup on table. Have measuring line on eye level.]

[Illustration: EGGS

2 Medium = ⅓ cup
2 Large = ½ cup
3 Medium = ½ cup
3 Large = ⅔ cup

=Eggs= vary in size ... so be sure to measure them. Never use less
than the minimum amount specified in recipe.]

MEASURE THAT PAN!

[Illustration:
_Do keep a ruler handy,
To measure pans it’s dandy.
Place the rule across the top,
Right size pan prevents a flop!_]

[Illustration: =Square Pan= ... 2″ to 2½″ deep.]

[Illustration:
=Round Layer Pan= ... at least 1¼″ deep for 8″ pan; 1½″ deep for 9″
pan.]

[Illustration: =Oblong Pan= ... 1½″ to 2½″ deep.]

[Illustration: =Tube-Center Pan= 4″ deep.]

[Illustration:
=Pie Pan= ... measured from _in_side rim to _out_side rim.]

[Illustration: =Bread Loaf Pan= 3½″ deep.]

[Illustration:
=Cooky Sheet or Baking Sheet= ... without sides.]

_Choose the size pan that the recipe states
When baking bar cookies, bread, pies, or fine cakes.
Measure with care to get just the right size,
It makes quite a diff’rence ... you’ll soon realize!_

[Illustration:
=Jelly Roll Pan or Baking Sheet= ... with low sides (½″).]

[Illustration: =Muffin Pan= ... deep or shallow cups.]

[Illustration: =Casserole or Baking Dish= ... with cover.]

[Illustration:
=Individual Custard Cups= ... set in shallow pan to bake.]

[Illustration: =Fluted Pudding Mold= ... for steamed puddings, etc.]

[Illustration: =Roasting Pan= ... with rack.]

HOW TO PREPARE some special ingredients the quick, easy way!

[Illustration: MELTING CHOCOLATE

Place it on waxed paper set in bowl over boiling water.]

_=or=_

[Illustration:
Place it in a small bowl set in a wire strainer over boiling water.]

[Illustration:
Remove melted chocolate from bowl or paper with rubber scraper.]

PREPARING NUTS

Some foods look and taste their best if the nuts in them are in big
chunks. In others, the nuts should be in smaller pieces. The recipes
tell you just how.

[Illustration:
=Broken Nuts=: It’s quick and easy to break nuts with fingers into
about ⅓-inch chunks.]

[Illustration:
=Cut-Up Nuts=: Cut with scissors (works better than knife) into
about ¼-inch pieces.]

[Illustration:
=Coarsely Chopped Nuts=: Chop with long, straight knife. Hold
point against cutting board, chop crisply through spread out
nuts—swinging handle around in quarter circle.]

=TOAST NUTS=: to be sure they will taste fresh. Heat through in
moderate oven.

[Illustration:
=Finely Chopped Nuts=: Chop same as for Coarsely Chopped, but into
finer pieces.]

[Illustration:
=Blanched Nuts=: Drop shelled nuts into boiling water. Let stand 2
to 5 minutes (until skins are loosened). Pour off hot water, add
some cold. Pinch each nut between thumb and finger to push off
skins, and lay nuts on plate or paper toweling to dry.]

[Illustration:
=Sliced or Slivered Nuts=: First blanch ... then cut with very
sharp knife while nuts are moist and warm.]

[Illustration:
=Ground Nuts=: Use fine knife of food grinder for finely ground ...
coarse knife for coarsely ground. Nuts should be dry.]

PREPARING DRIED FRUITS

[Illustration: KNOW YOUR RAISINS

=Seeded= raisins are the large variety from which seeds have been
removed. The sweetness released when they were slit open makes them
sticky.]

[Illustration:
=Seedless= raisins are the small variety, both dark and light ...
dried from seedless grapes. Cut them to get the full sweetness and
flavor.]

[Illustration:
=Plump= seedless raisins by washing and spreading them out in a
flat pan. Cover. Heat slowly in mod. oven (350°) until they puff up
and wrinkles come out.]

[Illustration: DATES

=Cut up= dates and other sticky fruits with wet scissors. Dip
scissors in water occasionally.]

[Illustration: PREPARING COCONUT

=Snip through= long shreds of coconut with scissors to shorten
them. The shorter shreds blend into doughs more evenly.]

[Illustration:
=To tint= shredded coconut: Soak it in milk or water (¼ cup for ½
cup coconut) with a few drops of food coloring added. Drain, dry on
absorbent paper.]

[Illustration:
=To cut citron= or candied orange or lemon peel, first _slice it
thinly_—then cut slices into ½″ or ¼″ squares.]

“_Cooky Shines_”

Won’t you come into our Kitchen and join us in our “Cooky Shines?”
That used to mean tea parties—but it’s what _we_ call our Staff
sessions of cooky baking. We have lots of fun trying out all the
delicious cookies that come to us from many lands. I’d like to
show you some of the cookies most popular with Staff members and
friends who have shared their favorite recipes with us. You’ll see
many varieties in the color picture on the next page. Please take a
look—then turn back.

_New, Easy, Double-Quick Way_

[Illustration: _DOUBLE-QUICK_]

Don’t all those cookies look tempting? And they’re ever so easy to
make! For we’ve worked out a new simplified method—a _double-quick_
method! Takes less than _half_ the usual mixing time! Would you like
to know the secret? Then turn to the step-by-step pictures following.
Imagine _you_ are standing right beside one of our Staff while
she makes cookies. Could anything be easier? There’s no laborious
creaming, no separate beating of eggs, only one bowl! Just a few
simple basic steps.

_More and Better Help_

Now turn to the recipe pages, and have the fun of making the many
different types of cookies. You’ll find all the little pointers you
would notice if you were right in our kitchen. For instance, there’s
a _brand-new feature_ which I think will be a big help to you. We
tell how to judge _when the cookies are done_. And don’t miss the
recipes marked with a ★! They are special favorites with our Staff!

_The “Key” Recipe Makes You Master of Many_

[Illustration]

You’ll love the new plan of _key recipes_ with variations. When you
master the key ( (KEY) ) recipe you’ll automatically know how to make
_several different kinds_ of cookies. And notice that each recipe
calls for our all-purpose Gold Medal “_Kitchen-tested_” Enriched
Flour. This is to safeguard your results.

Because you see, every recipe has been developed with and for this
particular flour—and tested in representative homes—with Gold Medal.
It gives that moist, full-flavored quality everyone _wants_ in
cookies.

_Recipes Fit the Needs_

The recipes are given in _practical_ amounts for average families.
Those for everyday cookies, and holiday cookies that keep well, make
enough so you won’t have to bake too often. Recipes for the richer,
dainty cookies make enough for _special_ occasions.

_Happy Memories_

[Illustration]

We’ve tried to include _all_ the hints, shortcuts and tricks that
save you time and work so you can delight your family with new
treats each week. Cookies bring such a _big_ reward in cheer and
satisfaction! They make hospitality _so easy_! Invite your friends to
join you for “Cooky Shines” in _your_ kitchen and you’ll be giving
them happy memories they’ll all cherish as long as they live!

COOKIES

[Sidenote: LEARN THE “A-B-C’s” HERE ...]

[Illustration: _BEFORE YOU START_

DO THIS....

Read through the recipe
Get together the ingredients
Collect the utensils
Heat up the oven
Measure the ingredients]

[Illustration:
=1= =Select= baking sheets (cooky sheets or pans) as indicated in
each recipe. Heavy or double sheets (two sheets of the same size
placed one on top of the other) prevent cookies from browning on
the bottom too much and too quickly.]

[Illustration:
=2= =If pan= with sides is used for cooky sheet, turn it
upside-down and bake cookies on the bottom ... (insures even
browning). Grease cool pans as indicated in recipes ... with
_unsalted_ shortening.]

[Illustration:
=3= =Mix= thoroughly the _softened_ shortening, sugar, and
eggs—also any molasses, syrup, or melted chocolate in the recipe.]

[Illustration:
=4= =Stir= in the liquid and flavoring. (A few recipes indicate
that liquid and flour mixture should be added alternately.)]

[Sidenote: ... AND THE REST IS EASY!]

[Illustration:
=5= =Sift= together and stir in the flour, salt, and leavening
(baking powder _or_ cream of tartar and soda)—also any spices in
the recipe. Then, mix in any fruit or nuts.]

[Illustration:
=6= =Chill= dough, if indicated in recipe, to make it easy to
handle. Then shape dough for different types of cookies as directed
in the recipe. Place on prepared pans.]

[Illustration:
=7= =Bake.= Place pan on rack in center of oven. If cooky tops do
not brown properly, move to a higher rack for last few minutes.
Pans should be narrower, shorter than oven (to leave a 1″ space for
circulation of heat).]

[Illustration:
=8= =Look= at cookies when minimum baking time is up. As soon as
they are done (according to recipe), remove from oven. With a wide
spatula, slip off baking sheet or out of pan onto wire rack to cool
(as recipe directs).]

=Store= cooled cookies properly to keep top eating quality. Keep
crisp, thin cookies in can with loose cover.

[Illustration]

=Keep= soft cookies in air-tight container (a covered earthen jar or
a can with tight cover). Slices of apple or orange in jar help mellow
and moisten cookies. Change fruit frequently.

Where to Find:
Drop Cookies 16-21

HOW TO MAKE DROP COOKIES (preliminary steps on pp. 14-15)
