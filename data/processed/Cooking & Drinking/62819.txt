[Illustration: {Baking Soda boxes}]

You may use these recipes with confidence. You will find that we have
carefully selected a most pleasing variety of old favorites and new,
delicious tempters. Many are pictured in color, so you can see what your
results will be. All have been critically tested ... for your
protection.

For the first time, you may observe the rich flavor and delicate texture
of baked products leavened and lightened with nature’s fruit juices and
nature’s acids, combined with baking soda. The crumb, soft as velvet,
the moisture thoroughly retained and the color, rich and inviting, are
outstanding results of this natural leavening. You don’t need to wait
for milk to sour, either; but ... the secret of successful baking is in

A Secret for successful baking

Successful baking is another way of keeping a family happy. For who
isn’t filled with the joy of living when tempted by the penetrating
aroma of Gingerbread, rich and spicy ... or a piece of luscious velvety
Chocolate Cake, full of flavor? What adds more zest to a meal than a
surprise plate of hot breads ... fragrant Cinnamon Buns, maybe Lemon
Clover Rolls, delicate Soda Biscuits or Old Fashioned Corn Bread?

The secret for making these successfully is as “old as the hills” but as
new as the morrow. Baking soda! Yes, grandmother used it in her prized
recipes and the modern homemaker finds it making her baking day a
success.

Arm & Hammer Brand and Cow Brand Baking Soda are refined bicarbonate of
soda whose standard of purity is that set up by the United States
Pharmacopoeia. For over 90 years this mild, healthful, alkaline
substance has been creating baking history. All these years homemakers
have depended on baking soda to make their baked products deliciously
moist and delicately light and tender.

“How,” asks the inexperienced homemaker, “does baking soda make cakes,
cookies and quick breads light and tender every time?”

Baking soda has stored in it a tremendous quantity of carbon dioxide
gas, the same gas found in soda water and ginger ale. This is released
when it comes in contact with any acid material such as the many mild
acids naturally found in cooking ingredients.

Among those ingredients are chocolate, cocoa, brown sugar, tomato juice,
sour milk, buttermilk, apple sauce, spices, cottage cheese, molasses,
vinegar, citrus fruit juices and many more. These acid ingredients are
familiar to everyone. One or more of them, you will notice, is used
almost every time you bake.

The baking soda gently but surely reacts with these natural acids,
freeing millions of tiny carbon dioxide bubbles which are held enmeshed
in the batters and doughs. As this gas expands during the baking, the
product becomes light and tender. Thus it is that baking soda uses
nature’s own unrivaled acids to leaven and lighten baked products.

Success Assured

Leavening nature’s way is surprisingly easy. The acid content of citrus
fruit juices or vinegar may be used to develop the unsurpassed flavor
and texture associated with baking soda products. The following amounts,

1⅓ tablespoons vinegar (4 teaspoons)
1½ tablespoons lemon juice (4½ teaspoons)
¾ cup orange juice (12 tablespoons)

may be used with ½ teaspoon baking soda. Many of the recipes in this
booklet are especially designed for this natural combination of baking
soda and acid juices. Sometimes the acid is added last as in the “Lemon
Loaf Cake” on page 11, while in the “Lemon Clover Rolls,” page 28, it is
combined with the liquid, then added to the mixture. In any case, you
will be pleased with the results.

IMPORTANT! You don’t need natural sour milk or buttermilk to prepare
your old time favorite delicacies. It is the acid normally found in
these ingredients which reacts with baking soda for leavening. If sour
milk or buttermilk with its natural acid is not available, you may
provide the necessary acid by using citrus fruit juices or vinegar with
sweet milk. It is surprisingly simple to change sweet milk to milk that
contains as much acid as natural sour milk or buttermilk when it is at
its best for baking.

For example, when vinegar is used to provide this acid, place 1⅓
tablespoons vinegar (white vinegar makes a whiter product) in a standard
measuring cup, then fill to the one-cup mark with sweet milk. Mix well.
The resulting liquid can be used in place of sour milk or buttermilk in
any baking soda recipe. Use 1½ tablespoons lemon juice or ¾ cup orange
juice in a similar manner.

In many of these recipes, designed in our Research Test Kitchen, one or
more acid ingredient is used to create perfect leavening with baking
soda.

Follow these recipes accurately and carefully, then enjoy the finer
flavor and even texture produced when baking with baking soda.

How to Bake

[Illustration: How to Bake]

FLOUR. Preferably use the kind of flour specified in the recipe. If you
substitute cake or pastry flour for all-purpose flour, use 2 additional
tablespoonfuls of flour for each cup required; to substitute all-purpose
flour for cake or pastry flour, remove 2 tablespoonfuls of flour from
each cup.

FATS. Solid fats can be used interchangeably. Melted fats or oils should
not be used in recipes specifying creaming of the shortening.

LIQUID. The use of citrus fruit juices, lemon and orange, is the most
recent accompaniment with sweet milk and baking soda for leavening. With
the health-giving qualities, this new use for fruit juices in baking is
widely accepted.

_Sweet milk may be used in place of sour milk if clabbered artificially.
To sour or clabber sweet milk quickly, place 1½ tablespoonfuls of lemon
juice or 1⅓ tablespoonfuls of vinegar (white vinegar makes a whiter
product) in a standard measuring cup, then fill to the one-cup mark with
sweet milk. Mix well. The resulting liquid will contain as much acid as
natural sour milk or buttermilk when it is at its best for baking, and
may be used exactly as natural sour milk or buttermilk in any baking
soda recipe._

MEASURING. Always use level measurements. Use standard measuring
equipment: a ½ pint cup marked in quarters and thirds; a set of standard
measuring spoons consisting of a tablespoon, teaspoon, ½ teaspoon and ¼
teaspoon.

MIXING. There is no such thing as “luck” in baking. Success depends on
good ingredients correctly combined. Follow the directions carefully as
set down in the following recipes.

BAKING. Keep the oven at the temperature specified in the recipe. You
have mastered an important part of baking, if you keep your oven under
control. Oven regulators and thermometers safeguard baking.

CARE AFTER BAKING. Let cakes stand in pan on cooling rack for 3 to 5
minutes after baking; then turn out on rack and finish cooling before
frosting. Cookies should also be cooled on a rack.

Facts regarding plain white flour

[Illustration: Facts regarding plain white flour]

In Arm & Hammer or Cow Brand Baking Soda recipes, certain types of flour
are used or specified simply to indicate that such a flour gives the
most desirable characteristics to that particular baked product, but it
does not mean that another type of flour cannot be substituted, nor that
an inferior product will result if a correct substitution is made.

BREAD FLOUR. This is used to a large extent by commercial bakers and
generally is made from hard wheats: it contains a high percentage of a
protein product known as gluten. The gluten in this flour is hard,
capable of taking up and retaining a large quantity of water. This
type of flour is admirably adapted for bread making, since the strong
gluten gives an excellent skeleton to the loaf. Such a flour is seldom
used in the home today, except by those who make large quantities of
home-made white bread. Usually, the gluten is present in this flour to
the extent of 11 to 12%.

GENERAL PURPOSE OR FAMILY FLOUR. This flour is intended to fill all
needs and, consequently, is made by blending flours from soft and hard
wheats. It contains a moderate amount of medium hard gluten, and is
used in baking hot breads, such as muffins and scones. However, it can
be used for pastries as well. When employed in place of pastry or cake
flour, two level tablespoonfuls less per cup should be used.
General-purpose flours range in gluten content from 10 to 11% and, in
this respect, are about half way between bread and true pastry or cake
flours.

PASTRY OR CAKE FLOUR. Such flours not only have the lowest gluten
content, but a weak soft gluten as well, and are very satisfactory for
making all pastries except such items as fruit cakes. These are
preferably made with all-purpose flour, to support the fruit and
maintain a desirable structure. Pastry flours contain 9 to 10% gluten
and are made from various types of soft wheat. Special cake flours
belong to the pastry flour class, but are finer in texture. They are
slightly lower in gluten content (8 to 9%), and the gluten is even
softer. Pastry flour gives baked products a tender thin crust and a
delicate crumb. Pastry flour can neither absorb nor retain moisture
like bread and all-purpose flours and, therefore, sour milk or
buttermilk is splendidly adapted for use with this flour, since both
are capable of retaining moisture.

If all-purpose or family flour is specified in a recipe, and only
pastry is available, increase the pastry flour slightly (two
tablespoonfuls for every cup of family flour specified). When pastry
flour is used in biscuit recipes, the dough is rather soft and
inclined to be somewhat difficult to roll. Instead of further
increasing the pastry flour to stiffen the dough, better results are
realized by using the dough for dropped biscuits.

Flour, baking soda and many other similar materials should be stored
in a dry cool place, free from odors.

Helpful Kitchen Hints

[Illustration: Helpful Kitchen Hints]

DRIED BEANS AND PEAS. When parboiling dried beans for baking, the
addition of ½ teaspoon of baking soda to each 2 cups soaked beans makes
the beans tender in a shorter time. When baked, the beans have a much
sweeter flavor than those parboiled in plain water. All dried legumes
such as lima, soy, kidney or navy beans, and peas, have a better flavor
if treated in this manner.

SCALLOPED DISHES. Scalloped potatoes or other scalloped dishes are
sometimes spoiled in appearance by curdling of the milk. ¼ teaspoon
baking soda to each pint of milk prevents the curdling.

HOMINY. In the preparation of hominy, use 1 ounce of baking soda (2
level tablespoons) and 3 pints of water to each pound of field corn.
Dissolve baking soda and add corn. Bring corn to boiling point, cover
and simmer 1½ hours. Hulls and black eyes can be removed by rubbing
between the hands. 6 or 7 washings will remove all traces of soda.

SPINACH. When washing spinach, add a small amount of baking soda (about
¼ teaspoon for each peck of spinach) to the last rinse water. Cook as
usual. The vegetable will retain its lovely fresh color.

RHUBARB AND GOOSEBERRIES. When stewing rhubarb or gooseberries, add ⅛
teaspoon baking soda for each 2 cups. This reduces the quantity of sugar
required by ⅓. For each 2 cups of rhubarb or gooseberries, use ⅔ cup
sugar in place of the usual cup.

PEACHES AND APRICOTS. To skin peaches and apricots quickly and easily,
blanch in a baking soda solution. To blanch, make a solution of ½ cup
baking soda to 2 gallons of water. Bring to boiling point and while
actively boiling, immerse fruit (using a wire basket) until skin is
loosened. Remove fruit, wash at once in clear cold water and remove
skins by rubbing.

BAKED HAM AND PORK CHOPS. When baking ham or pork chops in milk, the
addition of ¼ teaspoon baking soda to each pint of milk prevents the
curdling which so often detracts from the appetizing appearance of the
meat.

CORNED BEEF. When boiling corned beef, add ¼ teaspoon baking soda for
each pound of beef. This will improve the color and flavor of the meat.
Cabbage and other vegetables can be cooked in the same water without
becoming dark or slimy.

CLEANING MEAT. Clean all meat as soon as unwrapped with a baking soda
solution (1 teaspoon baking soda to 2 cups water). This removes foreign
matter and dried blood. Put on a clean plate and place in refrigerator.

FOWL. After drawing fowl, wash well, both inside and out, with a baking
soda solution (1 tablespoon to 2 quarts of water). Let solution run
through the bird several times. Rinse well with clear water. Pat dry
with clean towel.

FISH. Clean fish, both inside and out, in a baking soda solution (1
tablespoon to 2 quarts of water). Dip entire fish in the solution; wash
quickly and rinse in clear water. Dry immediately and store in cold
place. Before opening, wash clams and oysters with a brush dipped in the
baking soda solution. Fresh shrimp and other shell fish should be washed
well in the same strength baking soda solution before cooking.

CREAM OF TOMATO SOUP. To prevent curdling, when preparing cream of
tomato soup from canned or home-made tomato purée, add ⅛ teaspoon baking
soda to each cup of soup or purée before adding it to the milk.

Baking Soda Cleans—Too

[Illustration: Baking Soda Cleans—Too]

TILE FLOORS AND WALLS. To cleanse such surfaces soiled by splashed
water, etc., sprinkle baking soda on a damp cloth and rub briskly. Wipe
with cloth wrung from clean water and dry. The surface will be clean and
shiny. Arm & Hammer or Cow Brand Baking Soda will not harm tile or any
composition material resembling it.

ASH TRAYS. Unless cleaned daily these receptacles become offensive. To
cleanse, scrub trays either with a baking soda solution (a small handful
to a quart of warm water) or use a damp cloth sprinkled with bicarbonate
of soda. Rinse and dry. Brass and copper trays may require polishing
with a woolen or other polishing cloth.

LINOLEUM OR CONGOLEUM. Dissolve a large handful of baking soda in warm
mop water and clean. Rinse with clean water. Do not allow water to seep
under floor covering. This method of cleaning leaves the linoleum
(inlaid or printed) bright and clean and it will be neither sticky nor
slippery.

WASH-BOWLS, TUBS, ETC. Hard water is often responsible for scum and
sediment; grease and dirt adhere to surfaces. To remove these sprinkle
with baking soda and rub briskly with a damp cloth. Baking soda is
immediately soluble and will not clog drains or injure the finest
porcelain or enamel.

DRAIN BOARDS. Dampen surfaces, whether wood or enamel, and sprinkle with
Arm & Hammer or Cow Brand Baking Soda. Rub with a damp cloth, rinse and
wipe dry. Rubber or other composition drain boards may be cleaned in the
same way. Bicarbonate of soda, while being a most effective cleanser,
will not harm any of these surfaces.

GAS AND OIL STOVE BURNERS. Make a solution of one-quarter pound of
baking soda to one gallon of hot water. Bring to a boil. Immerse the
burners and boil for one hour. They will operate like new.

ENAMELED SURFACES. Enameled table tops, stoves, washing machines, etc.,
may be cleaned either by sprinkling the soda on the dampened surface or
washing with a baking soda solution (a handful to a basin of warm
water). This removes the oil or grease film which holds the dirt, and
leaves the surface clean and odorless.

MILK BOTTLES. Pour a little baking soda into the bottle, half fill with
cool water and shake. If milk is dried on, let bottle soak for a few
minutes. Cold water removes milk more quickly than hot, as hot water
causes a coating of milk to adhere to the glass. Bicarbonate of soda not
only hastens the cleansing process, but sweetens the bottle. Milk cans,
pails and all milk containers are cleansed in the same manner, using
more baking soda in greater quantities of water.

FIRE EXTINGUISHER. Arm & Hammer or Cow Brand Baking Soda is unsurpassed
as a fire extinguisher. It not only smothers the fire, but generates
carbonic acid gas which temporarily envelopes the flames, shuts off the
air supply or oxygen, and so extinguishes the fire.

BREAD BOXES. Cake and bread boxes, cooky jars, etc., after washing with
soap and water, should frequently be well rinsed with a baking soda
solution, a handful of baking soda to one quart of water. Rinse in clean
water and dry thoroughly. This treatment keeps them fresh and free from
odors.

CASSEROLES. Food that is burned onto or adheres to casseroles is easily
removed by soaking for a few minutes in warm water to which a small
handful of baking soda has been added. The bicarbonate of soda loosens
the encrusted particles.

REFRIGERATORS. Baking soda, refined mild bicarbonate of soda, is a
soluble cleanser, sweetener and polisher, and cannot scratch the
smoothest surface. It will remove odors by breaking up the oily surface
films, prevent fermentation by removing mold and retard the growth of
bacteria, thus keeping the refrigerator sanitary and fresh.

Whether the refrigerator is electric, gas, oil or ice, keep the inside
sweet and clean by wiping all surfaces with a soft cloth wrung from cool
or lukewarm water containing a handful of baking soda to each quart of
water, or by generously sprinkling baking soda on a damp cloth and
briskly rubbing the surface to be cleaned.

Keep ice cubes free from stale or musty flavors by cleaning the ice
trays each week with baking soda in a similar fashion. Also with a
baking soda solution, wash the food containers and the chilling tray
beneath the freezing unit.

In ice refrigerators, periodically remove drain pipe, ice chamber, pan,
trap and flues for a thorough washing with a hot solution of water and
baking soda. Rinse with clear water.

A baking soda solution (a small handful to a basin of water) may be used
to wipe the outer surfaces when soiled.

SILVER CLEANING. Silver may be cleaned easily and thoroughly by placing
it in an aluminum pan filled with a hot solution of baking soda, salt
and sugar, or in an enamel or granite pan, using a similar solution and
a small piece of aluminum such as a measuring spoon or pot cover. Use
about a tablespoon of each, baking soda, salt and sugar, for every quart
of hot water. Select a large container for convenience. Place the silver
in such a way that it is completely immersed and that each piece comes
in contact with the aluminum or a piece of silver touching the aluminum.
Let it stand until tarnish is removed and the silver becomes shiny and
bright. Heat if necessary. Rinse in hot water and rub dry. This method
removes absolutely no silver, hence it prolongs the life of silverware.
Since the aluminum article will be blackened in the process, do not use
one you care about keeping bright.

Large pieces of silver, such as candlesticks, cake plates, pitchers,
etc., may also be cleaned this way, making sure they are completely
immersed in the solution.

CUT GLASS. Goblets, tumblers and other cut glassware are satisfactorily
cleaned by rubbing the surface with a paste made of Arm & Hammer or Cow
Brand Baking Soda and water. Rinse with cold water and rub with a soft
brush. Soap is unnecessary.

CHOCOLATE POTS OR MIXING BOWLS. Dried-on chocolate needs a little
coaxing for removal. Sprinkle with baking soda, fill dishes with warm
water and let soak until their turn comes in the washing.

ODORS. Odors from dishes in which fish or onions are cooked, are quickly
killed by sprinkling baking soda in the dish and wiping out thoroughly
with tissue paper. Then wash in hot soapy water, rinse with hot water
and dry.

DOG KENNELS AND FEEDING DISHES. Scrub the inside of dog kennels
frequently with a baking soda solution, one package to three gallons of
hot water. Rinse.

To promote the health of pets, their feeding dishes must be cleansed
frequently. Let soak in a baking soda solution (a handful in a pan of
warm water). This loosens dried-on food. Wash and rinse.

BEVERAGE SERVICE. Cups, coasters, pitchers, glasses, spoons, punch
bowls, fruit containers, etc., are all successfully cleaned and
sweetened with bicarbonate of soda. The baking soda is best applied by
sprinkling on a moist cloth and then gently rubbing the object until
clean. Rinse with warm clear water and dry with clean towels having no
lint.

To clean bottles, decanters, flasks, shakers, etc., which do not permit
interior cleaning by hand, pour the baking soda into the container and
add a little warm (not hot) water. Shake well until clean, then rinse
with fresh water and allow to drain. This leaves the containers in a
sweet clean condition. Repeat after each use.

Cocktail sets made of glass, silver, etc., are excellently cleaned by
these methods.

THERMOS BOTTLES AND JUGS. To keep thermos bottles and jugs clean and
sweet, put a handful of baking soda in jug or bottle, partly fill with
warm water and shake well. Rinse with clean water. Corks and other
closures used for the bottles and jugs are kept odorless by rubbing with
moist baking soda.

VEGETABLE COOKERY

To PRESERVE the fresh green color of beans, peas and greens, a pinch of
baking soda (a pinch is less than ⅛ teaspoon) should be added to the
cooking water. Red vegetables will be most pleasing in appearance if a
little vinegar is added to the cooking water.

A little vinegar in the cooking water will keep white vegetables from
yellowing. In the case of old carrots, a pinch of baking soda will
shorten the cooking time.
