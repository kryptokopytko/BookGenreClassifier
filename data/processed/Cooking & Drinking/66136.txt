Home CANNING of Fruits and Vegetables

[Illustration: uncaptioned]

Organisms that cause food spoilage—molds, yeasts, and bacteria—are
always present in the air, water, and soil. Enzymes that may cause
undesirable changes in flavor, color, and texture are present in raw
fruits and vegetables.

When you can fruits and vegetables you heat them hot enough and long
enough to destroy spoilage organisms. This heating (or processing) also
stops the action of enzymes. Processing is done in either a
boiling-water-bath canner or a steam-pressure canner. The kind of canner
that should be used depends on the kind of food being canned.

Right Canner for Each Food

_For fruits, tomatoes, and pickled vegetables_, use a boiling-water-bath
canner. You can process these acid foods safely in boiling water.

_For all common vegetables except tomatoes_, use a steam-pressure
canner. To process these low-acid foods safely in a reasonable length of
time takes a temperature higher than that of boiling water.

A pressure saucepan equipped with an accurate indicator or gage for
controlling pressure at 10 pounds (240° F.) may be used as a
steam-pressure canner for vegetables in pint jars or No. 2 tin cans. If
you use a pressure saucepan, add 20 minutes to the processing times
given in this publication for each vegetable.

Getting Your Equipment Ready

Steam-Pressure Canner

_For safe operation_ of your canner, clean petcock and safety-valve
openings by drawing a string or narrow strip of cloth through them. Do
this at beginning of canning season and often during the season.

_Check pressure gage._—An accurate pressure gage is necessary to get the
processing temperatures needed to make food keep.

_A weighted gage_ needs to be thoroughly clean.

_A dial gage_, old or new, should be checked before the canning season,
and also during the season if you use the canner often. Ask your county
home demonstration agent, dealer, or manufacturer about checking it.

If your gage is off 5 pounds or more, you’d better get a new one. But if
the gage is not more than 4 pounds off, you can correct for it as shown
below. As a reminder, tie on the canner a tag stating the reading to use
to get the correct pressure.

The food is to be processed at 10 pounds steam pressure; so—

If the gage reads high—
1 pound high—process at 11 pounds.
2 pounds high—process at 12 pounds.
3 pounds high—process at 13 pounds.
4 pounds high—process at 14 pounds.

If the gage reads low—
1 pound low—process at 9 pounds.
2 pounds low—process at 8 pounds.
3 pounds low—process at 7 pounds.
4 pounds low—process at 6 pounds.

_Have canner thoroughly clean._—Wash canner kettle well if you have not
used it for some time. Don’t put cover in water—wipe it with a soapy
cloth, then with a damp, clean cloth. Dry well.

Water-Bath Canner

Water-bath canners are available on the market. Any big metal container
may be used as a boiling-water-bath canner if it is deep enough so that
the water is well over tops of jars and has space to boil freely. Allow
2 to 4 inches above jar tops for brisk boiling (see sketch). The canner
must have a tight-fitting cover and a wire or wooden rack. If the rack
has dividers, jars will not touch each other or fall against the sides
of the canner during processing.

If a steam-pressure canner is deep enough, you can use it for a water
bath. Cover, but do not fasten. Leave petcock wide open, so that steam
escapes and pressure does not build up inside the canner.

Glass Jars

Be sure all jars and closures are perfect. Discard any with cracks,
chips, dents, or rust; defects prevent airtight seals.

Select the size of closure—widemouth or regular—that fits your jars.

Wash glass jars in hot, soapy water and rinse well. Wash and rinse all
lids and bands. Metal lids with sealing compound may need boiling or
holding in boiling water for a few minutes—follow the manufacturer’s
directions.

If you use rubber rings, have clean, new rings of the right size for the
jars. Don’t test by stretching. Wash rings in hot, soapy water. Rinse
well.

Tin Cans

_Select desired type and size._—Three types of tin cans are used in home
canning—plain tin, C-enamel (corn enamel), and R-enamel (sanitary or
standard enamel). For most products plain tin cans are satisfactory.
Enameled cans are recommended for certain fruits and vegetables to
prevent discoloration of food, but they are not necessary for a
wholesome product.

The types of cans and the foods for which they are recommended are:

Type Recommended for—

C-enamel Corn, hominy.
R-enamel Beets, red berries, red or black cherries, plums,
pumpkin, rhubarb, winter squash.
Plain All other fruits and vegetables for which canning
directions are given in this bulletin.

In this bulletin, directions are given for canning most fruits and
vegetables in No. 2 and No. 2½ tin cans. A No. 2 can holds about 2½
cups, and a No. 2½ can about 3½ cups.

_Use only cans in good condition._—See that cans, lids, and gaskets are
perfect. Discard badly bent, dented, or rusted cans, and lids with
damaged gaskets. Keep lids in paper packing until ready to use. The
paper protects the lids from dirt and moisture.

_Wash cans._—Just before use, wash cans in clean water; drain upside
down. Do not wash lids; washing may damage the gaskets. If lids are
dusty or dirty, rinse with clean water or wipe with a damp cloth just
before you put them on the cans.

_Check the sealer._—Make sure the sealer you use is properly adjusted.
To test, put a little water into a can, seal it, then submerge can in
boiling water for a few seconds. If air bubbles rise from around the
can, the seam is not tight. Adjust sealer, following manufacturer’s
directions.

[Illustration: 76627B

A can sealer is needed if tin cans are used.]

General Canning Procedure

Selecting Fruits and Vegetables for Canning

Choose fresh, firm fruits and young, tender vegetables. Can them before
they lose their freshness. If you must hold them, keep them in a cool,
airy place. If you buy fruits and vegetables to can, try to get them
from a nearby garden or orchard.

For best quality in the canned product, use only perfect fruits and
vegetables. Sort them for size and ripeness; they cook more evenly that
way.

Washing

Wash all fruits and vegetables thoroughly, whether or not they are to be
pared. Dirt contains some of the bacteria hardest to kill. Wash small
lots at a time, under running water or through several changes of water.
Lift the food out of the water each time so dirt that has been washed
off won’t go back on the food. Rinse pan thoroughly between washings.
Don’t let fruits or vegetables soak; they may lose flavor and food
value. Handle them gently to avoid bruising.

Filling Containers

_Raw pack or hot pack._—Fruits and vegetables may be packed raw into
glass jars or tin cans or preheated and packed hot. In this publication
directions for both raw and hot packs are given for most of the foods.

Most raw fruits and vegetables should be packed tightly into the
container because they shrink during processing; a few—like corn, lima
beans, and peas—should be packed loosely because they expand.

Hot food should be packed fairly loosely. It should be at or near
boiling temperature when it is packed.

There should be enough sirup, water, or juice to fill in around the
solid food in the container and to cover the food. Food at the top of
the container tends to darken if not covered with liquid. It takes from
½ to 1½ cups of liquid for a quart glass jar or a No. 2½ tin can.

_Head space._—With only a few exceptions, some space should be left
between the packed food and the closure. The amount of space to allow at
the top of the jar or can is given in the detailed directions for
canning each food.

Closing Glass Jars

Closures for glass jars are of two main types:

_Metal screwband and flat metal lid_ with sealing compound. To use this
type, wipe jar rim clean after produce is packed. Put lid on, with
sealing compound next to glass. Screw metal band down tight by hand.
When band is tight, this lid has enough give to let air escape during
processing. Do not tighten screw band further after taking jar from
canner.

Screw bands that are in good condition may be reused. You may remove
bands as soon as jars are cool. Metal lids with sealing compound may be
used only once.

_Porcelain-lined zinc cap_ with shoulder rubber ring. Fit wet rubber
ring down on jar shoulder, but don’t stretch unnecessarily. Fill jar;
wipe rubber ring and jar rim clean. Then screw cap down firmly and turn
it back ¼ inch. As soon as you take jar from canner, screw cap down
tight, to complete seal.

Porcelain-lined zinc caps may be reused as long as they are in good
condition. Rubber rings should not be reused.

Exhausting and Sealing Tin Cans

Tin cans are sealed before processing. The temperature of the food in
the cans must be 170° F. or higher when the cans are sealed. Food is
heated to this temperature to drive out air so that there will be a good
vacuum in the can after processing and cooling. Removal of air also
helps prevent discoloring of canned food and change in flavor.

Food packed raw must be heated in the cans (exhausted) before the cans
are sealed. Food packed hot may be sealed without further heating if you
are sure the temperature of the food has not dropped below 170° F. To
make sure, test with a thermometer, placing the bulb at the center of
the can. If the thermometer registers lower than 170°, or if you do not
make this test, exhaust the cans.

_To exhaust_, place open, filled cans on a rack in a kettle in which
there is enough boiling water to come to about 2 inches below the tops
of the cans. Cover the kettle. Bring water back to boiling. Boil until a
thermometer inserted at the center of the can registers 170° F.—or for
the length of time given in the directions for the fruit or vegetable
you are canning.

Remove cans from the water one at a time, and add boiling packing liquid
or water if necessary to bring head space back to the level specified
for each product. Place clean lid on filled can. Seal at once.

Processing

Process fruits, tomatoes, and pickled vegetables in a boiling-water-bath
canner according to the directions on page 10. Process vegetables in a
steam-pressure canner according to the directions on page 16.

Cooling Canned Food

_Glass jars._—As you take jars from the canner, complete seals at once
if necessary. If liquid boiled out in processing, do not open jar to add
more. Seal the jar just as it is.

Cool jars top side up. Give each jar enough room to let air get at all
sides. Never set a hot jar on a cold surface; instead set the jars on a
rack or on a folded cloth. Keep hot jars away from drafts, but don’t
slow cooling by covering them.

[Illustration: BN21476

Cool jars top side up on a rack, leaving space between jars so air
can circulate.]

[Illustration: 76619B

Cool tin cans in cold water; change water frequently to cool cans
quickly.]

_Tin cans._—Put tin cans in cold, clean water to cool them; change water
as needed to cool cans quickly. Take cans out of the water while they
are still warm so they will dry in the air. If you stack cans, stagger
them so that air can get around them.

Day-After-Canning Jobs

Test the seal on glass jars with porcelain-lined caps by turning each
jar partly over in your hands. To test a jar that has a flat metal lid,
press center of lid; if lid is down and will not move, jar is sealed. Or
tap the center of the lid with a spoon. A clear, ringing sound means a
good seal. A dull note does not always mean a poor seal; if there’s no
leakage, store the jar and check it for spoilage before use.

If you find a leaky jar, use unspoiled food right away. Or can it again;
empty the jar, and pack and process food as if it were fresh. Before
using jar or lid again check for defects.

When jars are thoroughly cool, take off the screw bands carefully. If a
band sticks, covering for a moment with a hot, damp cloth may help
loosen it.

Before storing canned food, wipe containers clean. Label to show
contents, date, and lot number—if you canned more than one lot in a day.

Wash bands; store them in a dry place.

[Illustration: BN21468

Label jars after they have been cooled.]

Storing Canned Food

Canned food should be kept dry and cool, but it should not be subjected
to freezing.

_Dampness_ may corrode tin cans and metal lids of glass jars and
eventually cause leakage.

_Warmth_ may cause canned food to lose quality. Hot pipes behind a wall
sometimes make a shelf or closet too warm for storing food.

_Freezing_ may crack a jar or break a seal and let in bacteria that will
cause spoilage. If it does not damage jar or seal, freezing will not
make food unsafe to eat. To give food in an unheated place some
protection from freezing, cover containers with a blanket or wrap them
in paper.

On Guard Against Spoilage

Don’t use canned food that shows any sign of spoilage. Look closely at
each container before opening it. Bulging can ends, jar lids, or rings,
or a leak—these may mean food has spoiled. When you open a container
look for other signs—spurting liquid, an off odor, or mold.

It’s possible for canned vegetables to contain the poison causing
botulism—a serious food poisoning—without showing signs of spoilage.
There is no danger of botulism if pressure canner is in perfect order
and every canning step is done correctly. But unless you’re absolutely
sure of your gage and canning methods, boil home-canned vegetables
before tasting. Heating usually makes any odor of spoilage more evident.

Bring vegetables to a rolling boil; then cover and boil for at least 10
minutes. Boil spinach and corn 20 minutes. If the food looks spoiled,
foams, or has an off odor during heating, destroy it.

Burn spoiled vegetables, or dispose of the food so that it will not be
eaten by humans or animals.

How To Can Fruits, Tomatoes, Pickled Vegetables

Fruits, tomatoes, and pickled vegetables are canned according to the
general directions on pages 5 to 8, the detailed directions for each
food on pages 11 to 16, and the special directions given below that
apply only to acid foods.

Points on Packing

_Raw pack._—Put cold, raw fruits into container and cover with
boiling-hot sirup, juice, or water. Press tomatoes down in the
containers so they are covered with their own juice; add no liquid.

_Hot pack._—Heat fruits in sirup, in water or steam, or in extracted
juice before packing. Juicy fruits and tomatoes may be preheated without
added liquid and packed in the juice that cooks out.

[Illustration: BN21474

To hot pack fruit, pack heated fruit loosely into jars.]

[Illustration: BN21469

Cover fruit with boiling liquid before closing jars and processing
in boiling-water bath.]

Sweetening Fruit

Sugar helps canned fruit hold its shape, color, and flavor. Directions
for canning most fruits call for sweetening to be added in the form of
sugar sirup. For very juicy fruit packed hot, use sugar without added
liquid.

_To make sugar sirup._—Mix sugar with water or with juice extracted from
some of the fruit. Use a thin, medium, or heavy sirup to suit the
sweetness of the fruit and your taste. To make sirup, combine—

4 cups of water 2 cups sugar For 5 cups THIN sirup.
or juice
3 cups sugar For 5½ cups MEDIUM sirup.
4¾ cups sugar For 6½ cups HEAVY sirup.

Boil sugar and water or juice together 5 minutes. Skim if necessary.

_To extract juice._—Crush thoroughly ripe, sound juicy fruit. Heat to
simmering (185° to 210° F.) over low heat. Strain through jelly bag or
other cloth.

_To add sugar direct to fruit._—For juicy fruit to be packed hot, add
about ½ cup sugar to each quart of raw, prepared fruit. Heat to
simmering (185° to 210° F.) over low heat. Pack fruit in the juice that
cooks out.

_To add sweetening other than sugar._—You can use light corn sirup or
mild-flavored honey to replace as much as half the sugar called for in
canning fruit. Do not use brown sugar, or molasses, sorghum, or other
strong-flavored sirups; their flavor overpowers the fruit flavor and
they may darken the fruit.

Canning Unsweetened Fruit

You may can fruit without sweetening—in its own juice, in extracted
juice, or in water. Sugar is not needed to prevent spoilage; processing
is the same for unsweetened fruit as for sweetened.

Processing in Boiling-Water Bath

_Directions._—Put filled glass jars or tin cans into canner containing
hot or boiling water. For raw pack in glass jars have water in canner
hot but not boiling; for all other packs have water boiling.

Add boiling water if needed to bring water an inch or two over tops of
containers; don’t pour boiling water directly on glass jars. Put cover
on canner.

[Illustration: 76786B

After jars are covered with boiling water, place lid on water-bath
canner and bring water quickly back to boiling.]

When water in canner comes to a rolling boil, start to count processing
time. Boil gently and steadily for time recommended for the food you are
canning. Add boiling water during processing if needed to keep
containers covered.

Remove containers from the canner immediately when processing time is
up.

_Processing times._—Follow times carefully. The times given apply only
when a specific food is prepared according to detailed directions.

If you live at an altitude of 1,000 feet or more, you have to add to
these processing times in canning directions, as follows:

Altitude Increase in processing time if the time called for
is—

20 minutes or less More than 20 minutes
1,000 feet 1 minute 2 minutes.
2,000 feet 2 minutes 4 minutes.
3,000 feet 3 minutes 6 minutes.
4,000 feet 4 minutes 8 minutes.
5,000 feet 5 minutes 10 minutes.
6,000 feet 6 minutes 12 minutes.
7,000 feet 7 minutes 14 minutes.
8,000 feet 8 minutes 16 minutes.
9,000 feet 9 minutes 18 minutes.
10,000 feet 10 minutes 20 minutes.

To Figure Yield of Canned Fruit From Fresh

The number of quarts of canned food you can get from a given quantity of
fresh fruit depends upon the quality, variety, maturity, and size of the
fruit, whether it is whole, in halves, or in slices, and whether it is
packed raw or hot.

Generally, the following amounts of fresh fruit or tomatoes (as
purchased or picked) make 1 quart of canned food:

_Pounds_

Apples 2½ to 3
Berries, except strawberries 1½ to 3 (1 to 2 quart boxes)
Cherries (canned unpitted) 2 to 2½
Peaches 2 to 3
Pears 2 to 3
Plums 1½ to 2½
Tomatoes 2½ to 3½

In 1 pound there are about 4 medium apples, peaches, or tomatoes; 3
medium pears; 12 medium plums.

How To Can Vegetables

Can vegetables according to general directions on pages 5 to 8, the
detailed directions for each vegetable on pages 18 to 28, and special
directions below that apply only to vegetables.

Points on Packing

_Raw pack._—Pack cold raw vegetables (except corn, lima beans, and peas)
tightly into container and cover with boiling water.

_Hot pack._—Preheat vegetables in water or steam. Cover with cooking
liquid or boiling water. Cooking liquid is recommended for packing most
vegetables because it may contain minerals and vitamins dissolved out of
the food. Boiling water is recommended when cooking liquid is dark,
gritty, or strong-flavored, and when there isn’t enough cooking liquid.

Processing in a Pressure Canner

Use a steam-pressure canner for processing all vegetables except
tomatoes and pickled vegetables.

_Directions._—Follow the manufacturer’s directions for the canner you
are using. Here are a few pointers on the use of any steam-pressure
canner:

•Put 2 or 3 inches of boiling water in the bottom of the canner; the
amount of water to use depends on the size and shape of the canner.

•Set filled glass jars or tin cans on rack in canner so that steam can
flow around each container. If two layers of cans or jars are put in,
stagger the second layer. Use a rack between layers of glass jars.

•Fasten canner cover securely so that no steam can escape except through
vent (petcock or weighted-gage opening).

•Watch until steam pours steadily from vent. Let it escape for 10
minutes or more to drive all air from the canner. Then close petcock or
put on weighted gage.

•Let pressure rise to 10 pounds (240° F.). The moment this pressure is
reached start counting processing time. Keep pressure constant by
regulating heat under the canner. Do not lower pressure by opening
petcock. Keep drafts from blowing on canner.

•When processing time is up, remove canner from heat immediately.

_With glass jars_, let canner stand until pressure is zero. Never try to
rush the cooling by pouring cold water over the canner. When pressure
registers zero, wait a minute or two, then slowly open petcock or take
off weighted gage. Unfasten cover and tilt the far side up so steam
escapes away from you. Take jars from canner.

[Illustration: BN22389

To process vegetables, bring pressure in canner up to 10 pounds,
then start to count processing time.]

_With tin cans_, release steam in canner as soon as canner is removed
from heat by opening petcock or taking off weighted gage. Then take off
canner cover and remove cans.

_Processing times._—Follow processing times carefully. The times given
apply only when a specific food is prepared according to detailed
directions.

If you live at an altitude of less than 2,000 feet above sea level,
process vegetables at 10 pounds pressure for the times given.

At altitudes above sea level, it takes more than 10 pounds pressure to
reach 240° F. If you live at an altitude of 2,000 feet, process
vegetables at 11 pounds pressure. At 4,000 feet, use 12 pounds pressure;
at 6,000 feet, 13 pounds pressure; at 8,000 feet, 14 pounds pressure; at
10,000 feet, 15 pounds pressure.

A weighted gage may need to be corrected for altitude by the
manufacturer.

To Figure Yield of Canned Vegetables From Fresh

The number of quarts of canned food you can get from a given amount of
fresh vegetables depends on quality, condition, maturity, and variety of
the vegetable, size of pieces, and on the way the vegetable is
packed—raw or hot pack.

Generally, the following amounts of fresh vegetables (as purchased or
picked) make 1 quart of canned food:

_Pounds_

Asparagus 2½ to 4½
Beans, lima, in pods 3 to 5
Beans, snap 1½ to 2½
Beets, without tops 2 to 3½
Carrots, without tops 2 to 3
Corn, sweet, in husks 3 to 6
Okra 1½
Peas, green, in pods 3 to 6
Pumpkin or winter squash 1½ to 3
Spinach and other greens 2 to 6
Squash, summer 2 to 4
Sweetpotatoes 2 to 3

Questions and Answers

Q. _Is it safe to process foods in the oven?_

A. No, oven canning is dangerous. Jars may explode. The temperature of
the food in jars during oven processing does not get high enough to
insure destruction of spoilage bacteria in vegetables.

Q. _Why is open-kettle canning not recommended for fruits and
vegetables?_

A. In open-kettle canning, food is cooked in an ordinary kettle, then
packed into hot jars and sealed without processing. For vegetables, the
temperatures obtained in open-kettle canning are not high enough to
destroy all the spoilage organisms that may be in the food. Spoilage
bacteria may get in when the food is transferred from kettle to jar.

Q. _May a pressure canner be used for processing fruits and tomatoes?_

A. Yes. If it is deep enough it may be used as a water-bath canner (p. 4
). Or you may use a pressure canner to process fruits and tomatoes at 0
to 1 pound pressure without having the containers of food completely
covered with water. Put water in the canner to the shoulders of the
jars; fasten cover. When live steam pours steadily from the open vent,
start counting time. Leave vent open and process for the same times
given for the boiling-water bath.

Q. _Must glass jars and lids be sterilized by boiling before canning?_

A. No, not when boiling-water bath or pressure-canner method is used.
The containers as well as the food are sterilized during processing. But
be sure jars and lids are clean.

Q. _Why is liquid sometimes lost from glass jars during processing?_

A. Loss of liquid may be due to packing jars too full, fluctuating
pressure in a pressure canner, or lowering pressure too suddenly.

Q. _Should liquid lost during processing be replaced?_

A. No, never open a jar and refill with liquid—this would let in
bacteria and you would need to process again. Loss of liquid does not
cause food to spoil, though the food above the liquid may darken.

Q. _Is it safe to use canned food if liquid is cloudy?_

A. Cloudy liquid may be a sign of spoilage. But it may be caused by the
minerals in hard water, or by starch from overripe vegetables. If liquid
is cloudy, boil the food. Do not taste or use any food that foams during
heating or has an off odor.

Q. _Why does canned fruit sometimes float in jars?_

A. Fruit may float because pack is too loose or sirup too heavy; or
because some air remains in tissues of the fruit after heating and
processing.

Q. _Is it safe to can foods without salt?_

A. Yes. Salt is used for flavor only and is not necessary for safe
processing.

Q. _What makes canned foods change color?_

A. Darkening of foods at the tops of jars may be caused by oxidation due
to air in the jars or by too little heating or processing to destroy
enzymes. Overprocessing may cause discoloration of foods throughout the
containers.

Pink and blue colors sometimes seen in canned pears, apples, and peaches
are caused by chemical changes in the coloring matter of the fruit.

Iron and copper from cooking utensils or from water in some localities
may cause brown, black, and gray colors in some foods.

When canned corn turns brown, the discoloring may be due to the variety
of corn, to stage of ripeness, to overprocessing, or to copper or iron
pans.

Packing liquid may cause fading of highly colored foods. The use of
plain tin cans will cause some foods to lose color (p. 4).

Q. _Is it safe to eat discolored canned foods?_

A. The color changes noted above do not mean the food is unsafe to eat.
However, spoilage may also cause color changes. Any canned food that has
an unusual color should be examined carefully before use (p. 8).

Q. _Does ascorbic acid help keep fruits and vegetables from darkening?_

A. Yes. The addition of ¼ teaspoon of crystalline ascorbic acid (vitamin
C) to a quart of fruit or vegetable before it is processed retards
oxidation, which is one cause of darkening of canned foods. One teaspoon
of crystalline ascorbic acid weighs about 3 grams (or 3,000 milligrams).

Q. _Is it all right to use preservatives in home canning?_

A. No. Some canning powders or other chemical preservatives may be
harmful.

Q. _Why do the undersides of metal lids sometimes discolor?_

A. Natural compounds in some foods corrode the metal and make a brown or
black deposit on the underside of the lid. This deposit is harmless.

Q. _When canned or frozen fruits are bought in large containers, is it
possible to can them in smaller containers?_

A. Any canned or frozen fruit may be heated through, packed, and
processed the same length of time as recommended for hot packs. This
canned food may be of lower quality than if fruit had been canned when
fresh.

Q. _Is it safe to leave food in tin cans after opening?_

A. Yes. Food in tin cans needs only to be covered and refrigerated.

Q. _Is the processing time the same no matter what kind of range is
used?_

A. Processing times and temperatures in this bulletin are for canning in
a pressure canner or boiling-water bath with any type of range.

Q. _Can fruits and vegetables be canned without heating if aspirin is
used?_

A. No. Aspirin cannot be relied on to prevent spoilage or to give
satisfactory products. Adequate heat treatment is the only safe
procedure.
