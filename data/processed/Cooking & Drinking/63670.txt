_Why_ Sour Cream[1]?

[Illustration: Why Sour Cream?]

Dear Mrs. Homemaker:

This cookbook has been designed to introduce you to the many wonderful
ways that sour cream may be used to impart fine flavor and texture to
the foods you prepare. This book has been developed because we felt that
the full story of sour cream’s versatility has not been told.

Sour cream does wonders for your meals from soups to desserts. It is not
a new product. In fact, our grandmothers and their mothers before them
relied on sour cream to add fine full flavor to their cooking and
baking.

Perhaps one reason all people are not familiar with the wonders of sour
cream is a result of the name itself. The word “sour” may be misleading.
Sour cream today is a far superior product to that used in grandma’s
day. Today’s product is made from Grade A cream which has been
pasteurized and homogenized. Lactic culture is added to produce a rich,
clean, medium sharp cultured flavor.

Sour cream may be obtained from your milkman or at the food store.
Review the sour cream recipes in this booklet and open the door to new
taste-thrilling meals. You will be so delighted that sour cream will
become one of your favorite cooking and baking ingredients.

[1]In many communities, dairy sour cream is referred to as SALAD CREAM.
