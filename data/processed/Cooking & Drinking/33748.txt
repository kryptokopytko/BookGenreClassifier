The Truth about Oleomargarine

Swift's Premium Oleomargarine is a sweet, pure, clean, food product made
from rich cream and edible fats. It contains _every element of
nutrition_ found in the best creamery butter.

The process of manufacture is primitive in its simplicity, but modern in
its cleanliness and purity.

The butter fat in Swift's Premium Oleomargarine is microscopically and
chemically _the same_ as in the best butter; the only difference is _in
the way_ it is secured from the cow.

Butter fat in butter is all obtained by churning. In Swift's Premium
Oleomargarine from 1/3 to 1/2 obtained in that way, the remainder is
pressed from the choicest fat of Government inspected animals. This
pressed fat is called "Oleo" hence the name "Oleomargarine."

Rich cream, fancy creamery butter, 'oleo' 'neutral,' vegetable oil and
dairy salt are the _only_ ingredients of Premium Oleomargarine.
'Neutral' is pressed from leaf fat. It is odorless and tasteless.

There is _no coloring matter_ added to Premium Oleomargarine, yet it is
a tempting rich cream color.

Each week day during the year 1911 there has been an average of more
than 400 visitors through our Chicago Oleomargarine Factory.

In addition to this daily inspection by the visiting public our
factories are in complete charge of Government Inspectors.

These men test the quality and character of materials, they see that the
contents of every tierce of 'oleo' and 'neutral' received from the
Refinery is from animals that have passed the rigid Government
inspection. They see that everything about the factories is kept
absolutely clean and sanitary.

Read what a Government expert said about Oleomargarine:

The late Prof. W. O. Atwater, director of the United States Government
Agricultural Experiment Station at Washington:

"It contains essentially the same ingredients as natural butter from
cow's milk. It is perfectly wholesome and healthy and has a high
nutritious value."

Order a carton of Swift's Premium Oleomargarine today to try it. You
will find that it is a delicious, wholesome food product that you can
use in your home and effect a great saving, still maintaining your
standard of good living.

We particularly invite you to visit our factories and see for yourself
the cleanliness surrounding this interesting industry.

Recipes

You can make exactly as good cakes, pies, cookies, and candies by
substituting for the butter named in your recipes 3/4 the
quantity of Swift's Premium Oleomargarine. On this and the
following pages are a few recipes in which this substitution has
been made. Try them. You will find them good and more economical
than when made with butter.

You may have some favorite recipes that are too expensive on account
of the large amount of butter required. You can reduce their cost
by using Swift's Premium Oleomargarine.

Loaf Fig Cake

Light Part

1/2 cupful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine
1/2 cupful sweet milk
1-1/2 teaspoonfuls baking-powder
1 cupful sugar
1-1/2 cupfuls flour
1 teaspoonful vanilla
Whites of 4 eggs

Cream the oleomargarine and sugar. Add the milk, with which the
vanilla has been mixed. Sift the baking-powder with the flour and
add gradually. Add the whites, well beaten, last.

Dark Part

1/2 cupful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine
3/4 cupful milk
1-1/2 teaspoonfuls baking-powder
Yolks of 4 eggs
1/2 pound of raisins
1-1/2 cupfuls sugar
3 cupfuls flour
1 dessertspoonful each of cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and nutmeg
1 pound of figs

Cream the oleomargarine and sugar. Add the egg-yolks, well beaten,
then the milk. Sift the baking-powder and spices with the flour
and add gradually. The raisins should be seeded and dredged with
flour, and the figs should be cut in small pieces and dredged
with flour and added to the batter the last thing. Put in the pan
alternate layers of each part and bake in a loaf.

Sugar Cookies

1 cupful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine
1 cupful sour milk
1 teaspoonful soda
2 cupfuls sugar
3 eggs, well beaten
Flavoring to taste
Flour enough to roll out thin

Cream the oleomargarine and sugar. Add the eggs, whites and yolks
beaten together. Dissolve the soda in the sour milk. Add this and
then the flour. Roll out thin. Just before cutting out the
cookies sift granulated sugar on top and roll it in slightly,
then cut out cookies with cookie-cutter and bake in a moderate
oven.

Lemon Pie

1 cupful sugar
2 tablespoonfuls flour
Yolks of three eggs
1 cupful water
Juice and grated rind of 1 lemon
A lump of Swift's Premium Oleomargarine the size of an egg

Put all together in an oatmeal cooker and cook over hot water until
thick. Take from the fire and cool a little. Line a deep
pie-plate with crust, pour in the lemon mixture, and bake in a
moderate oven until the crust is done. Remove from the oven and
have ready the whites of the three eggs, beaten up stiff, with
three level tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar; spread this
meringue smoothly over the pie, return to the oven, and bake a
light brown.

Cornbread

1/4 cupful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine
1 cupful sweet milk
1 cupful cornmeal
1/4 cupful sugar
1 cupful flour
2 teaspoonfuls baking-powder
2 eggs

Sift together meal, flour, baking-powder, and sugar. To this add in
order the milk, the egg-yolks well beaten, the oleomargarine
melted and lastly the well-beaten whites of the eggs. Bake in a
hot oven for thirty to thirty-five minutes. This is particularly
delicious if just before it is done half a cupful of cream is
poured over the top.

On Baking-Day

When you wish a fine-grained cake, beat the whites of the eggs to a
stiff foam with a Dover egg-beater. If something spongy, such as an
angel cake, is desired, use a wire egg-beater, which makes a more
air-inflated foam.

Recipes in the older, much-prized cook-books often call for a teacupful
of yeast. A teacupful liquid yeast is equal to one cake of compressed
yeast.

To remove pecan meats whole, pour boiling water over nuts and let them
stand until cold. Then stand the nut on end and crack with a hammer,
striking the small end of the nut.

If beef or mutton drippings are used in making a pie-crust, beat them to
a cream with a teaspoonful of baking-powder and the juice of half a
lemon. This effectually removes all taste.

When a cake sticks to a pan, set it for a few minutes on a cloth wrung
out of cold water. It will then come out in good shape.

Heat the blade of the bread-knife before cutting a loaf of fresh bread.
This prevents the usual breaking and crumbling of the slices. For
cutting hot fudge, first dip the blade of the knife in boiling water.

Nothing is better for pudding molds than jelly tumblers with light tin
covers. One can readily tell when the puddings are done without removing
the covers.

The juice will not boil out of apple or berry pies if you dot bits of
Swift's Premium Oleomargarine near the outer edge.

A little salt in the oven under the baking-tins will prevent burning on
the bottom.

There is nothing more effective for removing the burned crust from cake
or bread than a flat grater. It works evenly and leaves a smooth
surface.

Use a wooden potato masher for stirring butter and sugar together for a
cake. It is much quicker than a spoon.

Renovating Suggestions

TO CLEAN A VELVET SUIT, sponge the spots with pure alcohol. Then suspend
the suit on a hanger in the bathroom in such a way that the air can
reach all sides of the garment. Turn on the hot water in the tub until
the steam fills the room; shut the door and windows; shut off the water,
and let the steam do its work for an hour. Then admit the air, but do
not touch the garment until it is perfectly dry.

TO REMOVE SHINE FROM WOOLEN GOODS, use gentle friction with emery paper.
Rub just enough to raise the nap, and then rub it over with a piece of
silk.

TO MEND KID GLOVES, first buttonhole around the rent not so close as in
a buttonhole; then overcast, taking up the thread of the buttonhole on
the edge, and then draw together.

TO CLEAN MEN'S COAT COLLARS, rub with a black stocking saturated with
grain alcohol. This will remove the greasy look.

TO FRESHEN A THIN DRESS, dissolve two teaspoonfuls of elastic starch in
half a cupful of lukewarm water, and with a soft rag dampen on the right
side, then with a hot iron press on the wrong side.

TO CLEAN GREASE SPOTS FROM SILK, split a visiting card and rub the soft
internal part on the spot on the wrong side of the silk. The spot will
disappear without taking the gloss off the silk.

TO MEND LACE CURTAINS, take a small piece of net, dip it and the
curtains in hot starch, and apply the patch over the hole. The patch
will adhere when dry, and the repair will show much less than if the
curtains were mended.

TO RENEW VEILS, dip them in gum-arabic water, and pin them out to dry as
you would a lace curtain. When dry they will look like new.

TO FRESHEN BLACK TAFFETA OR SATIN, sponge with a cupful of strong tea to
which a little ammonia has been added. Then press on the wrong side over
a damp cloth.

TO REMOVE PERSPIRATION STAINS, lay the stain over clean white
blotting-paper, and sponge with equal parts of alcohol and ether mixed.
Rub dry, then touch lightly with household ammonia. If this leaves a
blur, rub well with powdered French chalk on the wrong side. The
blotting-paper prevents the fluids from forming a ring around the spot.

House-Cleaning Hints and Helps

TO CLEAN LINEN SHADES, lay them flat and rub with powdered bath-brick.

TO CLEAN PIANO KEYS, rub with muslin dipped in alcohol. If the keys are
very yellow, use a piece of flannel moistened with cologne water.

TO CLEAN BOOKS with delicate bindings, which are soiled from handling,
rub with chamois skin dipped in powdered pumice stone.

TO RESTORE STRAW MATTING which has become stained or faded, wash with a
strong solution of soda water. Use ordinary baking soda and plenty of
Swift's Pride Soap and wash thoroughly, and when dry it will be found
that the spots have all disappeared and the matting is all one color.

TO CLEAN GLASS VASES, tea-leaves moistened with vinegar will remove the
discoloration in glass vases caused by flowers, such as asters.

TO CLEAN WINDOWS AND MIRRORS, rub them over with thin cold starch, let
it dry on, and then wipe off with a soft cloth. This will clean the
glass and also give it a brilliant polish.

TO REMOVE PAINT from window glass, use strong hot vinegar.

TO REMOVE WHITE SPOTS FROM FURNITURE, rub first with oil, and then with
slightly diluted alcohol.

TO REMOVE STAINS from an enameled saucepan, fill with water, add a
little chloride of lime, and boil for a few minutes.

TO CLEAN WILLOW-WARE, wash with salt water, using a brush.

TO POLISH THE GLOBES of gas and electric-light fixtures, wash with water
in which a few drops of ammonia have been dissolved.

TO CLEAN TILING, wipe with a soft cloth wrung out in soapy water. Never
scrub tiling, as scrubbing or the use of much water will eventually
loosen the cement and dislodge the sections.

TO BRIGHTEN NICKEL trimmings on a gas stove, wash with warm water, in
which two tablespoonfuls of kerosene have been stirred.

TO SAVE DUSTING, a piece of cheese cloth about two yards long placed on
the floor in a freshly swept room will save much of the usual dusting.

Laundry Helps

A few cents' worth of powdered orris-root put in the wash water will
impart a delicate odor to the clothes.

Hot milk is better than hot water to remove fruit stains.

To remove spots from gingham, wet with milk and cover with common salt.
Leave for two hours, then rinse thoroughly.

In washing white goods that have become yellow, put a few drops of
turpentine into the water, then lay on the grass to dry in the strong
sunshine.

To make wash silk look like new, put a tablespoonful of wood alcohol to
every quart of water when rinsing and iron while still damp.

When washing, if the article is badly soiled, use a small scrubbing
brush and scrub the goods over the washboard.

To set green or blue, mauve or purple, soak the articles for at least
ten minutes in alum water before washing them. Use an ounce of alum to a
gallon of water. To set brown or tan color, soak for ten minutes in a
solution made of a cupful of vinegar in a pail of water. Black goods and
black-and-white goods need to be soaked in strong salt water, or to have
a cupful of turpentine put into the wash water. Yellows, buffs, and tans
are made much brighter by having a cupful of strong, strained coffee put
in the rinsing water.

When ironing fine pieces, instead of sprinkling afresh, take a piece of
muslin, wring it out in cold water, and lay on the ironing board under
the article; press with a warm iron; remove the wet piece and iron.

When making starch for light clothes use Wool Soap in the water. This
will give the clothes a glossy appearance and the irons will not stick.

Badly scorched linen may be improved by using the following solution:
Boil together well a pint of vinegar, an ounce of Wool Soap, four ounces
of fuller's earth, and the juice of two onions. Spread this solution
over the scorched spots on the linen and let it dry. Afterward wash the
garment and the scorch will disappear.

To keep the clothes-line from twisting, hold the ball of rope in one
hand and wind with the other until a twist appears; then change ball to
the other hand and the twist will disappear. Keep doing this, changing
the rope from one hand to the other until the line is all wound up.

About House Plants

To make ferns grow better, place some thin pieces of raw beef close to
the inside of the pot, between the pot and the soil.

Old-fashioned portulaca makes a pretty low-growing green for a fern
dish.

To prevent plants from dropping their buds, give extra good drainage and
systematic but moderate watering.

An infallible wash for destroying the scaly insects that infest house
plants is made as follows: Place half a bar of Swift's Pride Laundry
Soap in a deep saucer and pour kerosene around it. Let this stand for
about a week until the soap has absorbed the oil. Then make a strong
lather of this soap and with it wash the plants. After which spray them
with clear water until clean.

To destroy aphis, shower foliage of infested plant on both sides with
strong tobacco tea, or, if the plant be small enough, immerse it in this
tea.

Insects in the earth of a potted plant may be destroyed by pouring over
the soil a glass of water in which a pinch of mustard has been stirred.

If an asparagus fern turns yellow, repot it, giving it a strong loam
enriched with one-fifth very old and finely crumbed manure and add a
little coarse sand. Give the fern only an hour or two of sunlight each
day. Water when it looks dry, but do not let it stand in any water that
may have run through into the saucer.

Before putting plants in a wooden window box whitewash the inside of the
box. This not only keeps the box from rotting, but prevents insects.

If sprays of growing nasturtiums are broken off in the late summer and
placed in a bowl of water they will root and grow all winter.

How to Use the Cheaper Cuts of Meat

Much time has been given in the last few years to the study of foods,
their necessary proportions, and the manner of cooking them. Educators
and scientists have alike agreed that this knowledge ought to be
disseminated. On the part of the public also there has been a general
awakening in this regard. There has been a wide demand especially from
those of limited incomes for information on the purchase and preparation
of foods. To meet this demand books have been published and articles
have appeared in the various women's papers giving directions for living
at all sorts of prices, from the extremely low one, "How to Live on Ten
Cents a Day," to the normal one which requires the preparation of
appetizing and satisfying dinners at a nominal cost.

In order to accomplish living comfortably at small cost it is evident
that one must understand the comparative values of foods, so as to
select those which at low prices furnish the necessary nourishment, and,
also, be able to cook them in an appetizing way which will conserve the
nourishment. Meat is a necessity to most people. Yet much of the present
expense in the purchase of meat is needless and unwise. Many pieces of
meat of the best quality are sold at low rates because not in shapes to
be served as roasting or broiling pieces. These serve well for entrees
or made-up dishes. Other pieces which are tough but well flavored can,
in the hands of an educated cook, be sent to the table as tender,
palatable, sightly and nutritious as the prime cuts. It is to show some
methods of preparing these cheaper cuts of meat in an appetizing manner
that the following explanation of the processes of cooking and the
accompanying recipes are given.

Meat is cooked, first, to aid digestion; secondly, to develop new
flavors and render it more palatable.

For cooking there are three essentials besides the material to be
cooked--namely, heat, air, and moisture, the latter in the form of
water, either found in the food or added to it.

The combined effect of heat and moisture swells and bursts starch
grains, hardens albumen, and softens fiber.

Albumen is a substance like the white of an egg. It exists in the juices
of meat and contains much nourishment. If allowed to escape, the
nourishment is lost and the meat is hard. Therefore we have the first
general rule for the cooking of meat, namely:

_To retain the albumen, the outside of each piece of meat should be
seared or sealed at once before the cooking is continued._

Albumen is coagulated and hardened by intense heat. Therefrom comes the
second general rule, namely:

_Intense heat hardens and toughens meat, while a soft moist heat softens
the fiber._

From these general rules we pass to the specific methods of cooking
meat, which are nine in number--broiling, roasting, baking, frying,
sauteing, steaming, boiling, stewing, or fricasseeing.

Broiling and roasting are practically the same, the chief difference
being in the time employed. Both mean to expose one side of the meat to
the fire while the other is exposed to the air. By this method the meat
is quickly seared and the nutritive juices retained. Meat cooked in this
way is richer and finer in flavor.

Baking means cooking in a pan in the oven of a stove, and in these days
of hurry has largely superseded roasting.

Frying is the cooking by immersion in hot fat at a temperature of 350
degrees Fahrenheit. There must be sufficient fat to wholly cover each
article. This method is employed for croquettes, oysters, etc., and is
less injurious to digestion than sauteing.

Sauteing is cooking in a small quantity of fat, as an omelet or hashed
browned potatoes are cooked. This is the least wholesome of all methods
of cooking meat, and is often held directly responsible for indigestion.

Steaming is an admirable method of cooking tough meats or hams. Modern
housewives use a "cooker," which comes for this purpose, but the
old-fashioned perforated steamer over a kettle of boiling water is also
good.

Boiling is one of the simplest methods of cooking the cheaper cuts of
meat. Properly employed, it consists in plunging the whole piece of meat
in a large kettle of rapidly boiling water. The meat should be entirely
covered by the water, which should continue to boil rapidly for five
minutes after the meat has been immersed in it. The temperature of the
water should then be immediately lowered to 160 degrees Fahrenheit. If
one has not a cooking thermometer, one has only to remember that water
boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit, and it will easily be seen that 160
degrees is considerably below the boiling point.

Stewing or fricasseeing is really cooking slowly in a sauce after the
meat has first been browned in a little hot fat. If the mixture is
allowed to boil the meat will be tough and shriveled, but if properly
stewed it will be soft and easy to digest. Fricasseeing is the most
economical of all methods of cooking meat, as there is very little loss
in weight, and what is lost from the meat is found in the sauce.

Braising is a method much used in France, and is a cross between
boiling and baking. It is done in a covered pan in the oven. The meat is
first browned in a little hot fat and then placed in a pan which is
partly filled with stock or water. The pan is covered closely and set in
a hot oven. After ten minutes the temperature of the oven is reduced to
a very low point, and the meat cooks slowly as the stock in the pan
evaporates. This method is the best for inferior pieces which require
long, slow cooking. It is an excellent method of cooking veal. Meat
which is lacking in flavor can be flavored by adding vegetables or herbs
to the stock in the pan.

Different cuts of meat require different methods of cooking to bring
about the best results. The following diagram and the accompanying
suggestions for proper cuts for certain methods of cooking are those
given by a prominent teacher in one of the leading domestic science
schools in the United States.

The Practical Value and Use of Fireless Cookers

_The object of the following article is to present in simple and
convenient form the history of the growth of fireless cooking and its
advantages over the ordinary methods, so that those women who have had
no experience in the management of fireless cookers may be encouraged to
try them, and those adventurous women who experimented with the earlier
cookers and met with disappointment may be induced to try again._

_Such eminent authorities as Linda Hull Larned, author of a series of
cook-books; Margaret J. Mitchell, Instructor of Domestic Science at
Drexel, Pa., and formerly Dietitian of Manhattan Institute State
Hospital, N. Y.; Mrs. Runyon, manager of the lunchroom in the Boston
Chamber of Commerce; and Miss Armstrong, director of the Drexel
Institute lunchroom--all advocate the use of fireless cookers, and unite
in the assertion that it has invariably been found that a good
understanding of their management has resulted in success followed
inevitably by enthusiasm._

The Practical Value and Use of Fireless Cookers

This twentieth century is the age of progress in many directions, but
most of all in Domestic Science. Never before has so much attention been
devoted to the home. Journalists are giving columns of space to this
topic. Churches are directing their efforts to the betterment of the
home. Women's Clubs and charitable organizations have taken up the study
of the home. The most important result of all this action and thought is
the widespread awakening to the fact that the social and moral standing
of the home is directly dependent upon its hygienic and economic
condition.

In view of this fact, the National Federation of Women's Clubs has
practically covered the United States with their County, State, and
National Committees on Housekeeping. They know that bad cooking in the
home means unsatisfied stomachs, to gratify whose cravings the saloons
are filled; it means anemic children, a physical condition that tends to
produce criminals; it means premature funerals. To remedy these evils,
churches, journalists, philanthropists, clubs are alike working, and all
are working along the same lines--that is, better home furnishings,
better fuels, better utensils, more efficient, more economic, and less
laborious methods of housekeeping. They have not only sought and
introduced new inventions, but they have studied the past and adapted
and bettered the old.

Among the adaptations of the old ideas with new and modern improvements
is the fireless cooker. Ages ago Norwegian and German peasant women,
obliged to be away from the house all day working in the fields, knew
the secret of bringing food to the boiling point and then continuing its
cooking and keeping it hot by packing it in an improvised box of hay. In
the evening when the women returned, weary and worn from their field
labor, there was the family dinner all ready to serve.

German club women were the first to see the value of this idea adapted
to the needs of the German working class of the present day. These
German club women revived the hay boxes and distributed numbers of them
among poor families and began an educational campaign on their use. The
American manufacturer, ever on the alert for ideas, was quick to
perceive the economic and commercial advantages of making such an
appliance in an up-to-date manner, and so to-day we have on the market
numerous fireless cookers.

The principle of fireless cooking, though it bears the difficult name
of recaloration, is simple enough. It is merely the retention of heat
through complete insulation, just as we retain cold in the ice-box by
complete insulation. In the first case, a material which is a poor
conductor of heat is interposed between the kettle of hot food and the
surrounding atmosphere to prevent radiation or the escape of heat into
the surrounding air. In the second case, a poor conductor of heat is
placed between the ice and the warmer surrounding atmosphere to prevent
the contact of the atmosphere with the ice and the consequent
equalization of temperatures. A vacuum is an excellent non-conductor of
heat and is employed in the Thermos bottles advertised for use on
automobile trips, but a vacuum is expensive and difficult to obtain,
which accounts for the high price of Thermos bottles. The effort has
been to find some insulating agent within the means of the average
housewife. This has now been done in the metal-lined cookers.

The explanation of the cooking principle is equally simple. Ordinarily
we heat food to a certain temperature, say, the boiling point, and then
we leave it over the fire for some time, not to get hotter, that would
be impossible, but to keep it at the same degree of heat, and to do this
we must, on account of radiation into the surrounding atmosphere, keep
on supplying heat. In the fireless cooker the heat once generated is
conserved, and there is no need to add thereto.

Herein lies the economy in fuel. You have only to burn gas long enough
to bring the food to the boiling point, and the fireless cooker does the
rest. You can put dinner on to cook, and go to work, to the theatre, to
visit a friend, or read, or sew, without giving your meal any further
attention till time to serve it. This sounds like a fairy tale, but it
is absolutely true.

By the fireless cooker you save nine-tenths of the fuel, and ninety-nine
hundredths of your temper, your time, and your labor. You do not become
perspiring and cross in a hot kitchen. You do not have scorched pots and
kettles to scrape and scour and wash.

Another point in favor of fireless cooking is that it is attended by
absolutely no odors. Such vegetables as onions and cabbage can be cooked
without any one's suspecting they are in the house.

The economy in using the fireless cooker is not confined solely to a
saving in gas and labor. There is also an actual and great economy in
food, for there is almost no waste in this method of cooking. Take for
example a 5-pound piece of beef from the round. Put this in the kettle
of the fireless cooker with a pint of water for each pound of meat.
Heat it on the gas range slowly, taking about twenty minutes to bring it
to the boiling point. Then, according to directions, place it in the
fireless cooker and finish the cooking. When it is done and tender, it
will be found that there is only a minute loss in weight; to be exact, 2
ounces for 5 pounds. You bought 5 pounds of meat and have to serve on
your table 4 pounds and 14 ounces. You could not make any such showing
if you had cooked the meat on a gas or coal range.

Four pounds and 14 ounces, however, is not all that you have to serve.
You originally added to your meat 5 pints of water. A little of this
evaporated or cooked away in the twenty minutes primary cooking on the
stove. All the rest is retained, for there is absolutely no evaporation
in a fireless cooker. This water has added to it the nutritive value and
flavor acquired from the meat. So besides your 4 pounds and 14 ounces of
meat you have over 4 pints of rich soup stock which has cost you
absolutely nothing, as it is a by-product of the system of fireless
cooking.

"But," objects some one, "the meat cooked in such wise will have lost
all its juice and flavor." On the contrary, there is a distinct gain in
the matter of flavor in fireless cookery. We absolutely know this to be
so, for we have had various cuts of meat, especially the cheaper cuts,
cooked in a fireless cooker and the dishes so prepared have been
submitted to competent judges; the opinion was unanimous that there was
a real difference between the flavor of meats so cooked and that of
corresponding cuts cooked after the usual methods, and that the delicacy
and richness of flavor lay with those meats cooked by the fireless
method.

When one understands the principles of cookery this richness of flavor
of meats cooked by the fireless method is not surprising. Every one
knows the proverbial deliciousness of French cookery. The special
peculiarity of the French cuisine is the long, slow simmering of meats
in closely covered earthen pots called casseroles. The principle is
essentially that of the fireless cooker, but the casserole not being
insulated, the French cook is obliged to keep on supplying a sufficient
degree of heat to keep the casserole warm and its contents simmering.

Examples of fireless cooking with which many persons are familiar by
experience or hearsay are the foods cooked in primitive ways, whose
deliciousness is generally ascribed to the "hunger sauce" that
accompanies outdoor cookery. Among such examples are the burying of the
saucepan in a hole in the ground, the cooking of food by dropping heated
stones into the mixture, and the clambake known among the Narragansett
Indians. In all these cases we have the principle of the fireless
cooker--_i. e._, closely-covered food slowly cooked at low temperature.
Indeed, one fireless cooker is constructed directly on the principle
employed in the New England clambake, and every one knows the
deliciousness of food so cooked has become proverbial.

By the fireless cooker the cheaper cuts of meat can be cooked so that
they are delicious, appetizing, tender. There is here a distinct saving
in money, for by the employment of the fireless method of cooking, the
cheaper cuts of meat can be made to serve all the purposes of the
higher-priced pieces. Further, if the meats are stewed, boiled, or
steamed, you also acquire at no cost whatever as many pints of delicious
soup stock, less one, as you have pounds of meat.

Let us now recapitulate the advantages of fireless cooking:--

A Fireless Cooker Saves Money

1. Because by its use cheaper meats can be made to answer as well as
higher-priced cuts.

2. Because out of a given quantity of raw material you get, after the
cooking is done, more actual food than by any other method.

A Fireless Cooker Saves Fuel

You have only to burn your gas twenty minutes for a 5-pound piece of
meat for fireless cooking, whereas by the usual method you would burn
the gas two to four hours, according to the way you desired the meat
cooked.

A Fireless Cooker Saves Time

Because you have only to watch the meat until it boils. By the usual
method you must attend to it all the hours it is on cooking.

A Fireless Cooker Saves Irritation and Worry

For by this method of cooking the housewife knows that the food cannot
burn or overcook.

A Fireless Cooker Adds to the Intellectual Expansion and the Pleasures
of the Family

Because it gives the mother time from her kitchen to oversee the
development of her children, and to share with them and their father
their pleasures and interests.

To the Wage-earning Woman

the fireless cooker is a positive godsend. She can put food into the
cooker before going to work, and return to find her meal all ready.

If the Housewife Lives in the City

and has to serve dinner at night all the preliminary cooking can be done
at noon, and the meal placed in the fireless cooker till evening.

To the Bachelor Girl

who lives by means of a kitchenette, and must do her cooking in what is
at once parlor, bedroom and kitchen, what a blessing is the absence of
heat and odors that the fireless cooker assures.

In Conclusion

we quote from a bulletin published by the University of Illinois, in
which a study is made of the methods of roasting and cooking meats. The
authors found that there was no advantage in cooking meat in a very hot
oven (385 degrees Fahrenheit), but rather a difficulty to keep it from
burning; that in an oven which was about 350 degrees Fahrenheit the meat
cooked better; and that in an Aladdin oven, which kept the meat at 212
degrees Fahrenheit, it cooked best of all--that is, it was of more
uniform character all through, more juicy and more highly flavored.
These findings point to an advantage in fireless cooking, and Miss
Mitchell asserts that practical experience bears it out. With regard to
meats cooked in water in the cooker, Miss Mitchell asserts that
experience has shown that they become well done and are more tender than
when boiled, showing that the temperatures necessary to reach that
degree of cooking are obtained even in the center of a large piece of
meat, without toughening or hardening the outside of the meat, as is
done when more intense heat is applied.

Recipes

The following recipes are for the cheaper cuts of meat exclusively, and
employ one or another of the preceding methods. Note that in all the
recipes the two general rules for tender and juicy meat are observed.
The outside of the meat is first quickly seared over to prevent the
escape of the juices, and after the first five minutes the heat is
reduced so as not to harden the albumen. Boiled or fricasseed meats
should cook slowly. If meat is boiled at a gallop the connective tissue
is destroyed, the meat falls from the bones in strings, and is hard and
leathery.

For stews, meat en casserole, or in any fashion where water is used in
the cooking, select the round (5), either upper or under. For boiling,
the clod (9) or the round (5) or the extreme lower piece of (3). For
rolled steak, mock fillet, steak a la Flamande, or beefsteak pie, the
flank steak (7) is best. For cheap stews use (10). For beef a la mode,
in a large family use a thick slice of the round (5), for a small family
the clod (9). For soup, use the shin or leg. For beef tea, mince meat,
and beef loaf, the neck is best. The chuck (1) is used only for roasting
or baking, and is good value only for a large family. (2) and (3) are
the standing ribs and carve to the best advantage. The aitch or pin bone
(in 3) is a desirable roast for a large family. (3) is the loin, the
choicest part of the animal. From it come the fillet or tenderloin, the
sirloin, and the porterhouse steaks. (4) is the rump, from which come
good steaks for broiling.

Beef Cannelon with Tomato Sauce

(One of the nicest and easiest of the cheap dishes)

Use Flank Steak (7)

1 pound uncooked beef chopped fine
1 cupful cold boiled potatoes
1 teaspoonful salt
1 egg unbeaten
1/4 teaspoonful white pepper
1/2 cupful Swift's beef extract
1 tablespoonful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine

Mix together beef, potatoes, salt, and pepper, and stir in egg last.
Form into a roll 6 inches long. Roll this in a piece of white
paper which has been oiled on both sides. Place in a baking-pan
and add the beef extract and the oleomargarine. Bake half an
hour, basting twice over the paper.

{Footer: Swift's Premium Oleomargarine reduces the cost of good living.}

To serve beef cannelon, remove the paper, place the roll on the
platter, and pour over it

Tomato Sauce

1 tablespoonful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine
1 cupful strained tomatoes
1 teaspoonful onion juice
1 tablespoonful flour
1/4 teaspoonful white pepper
1 bay-leaf

Add onion, bay leaf, salt and pepper to tomatoes. Rub the
oleomargarine and flour together and place in inner kettle of
oatmeal cooker, set over the fire, add the tomato, and stir until
it boils. Then place the kettle over hot water in the lower half
of the oatmeal cooker, and cook so for ten minutes, when it is
ready to serve.

Spanish Minced Beef in Meat Box

(Very pretty and palatable)

Use any of the cheaper cuts.

The Filling

1 tablespoonful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine
1 onion chopped fine
6 sweet peppers cut in strips
4 tomatoes peeled, cut in halves and seeds squeezed out
1/2 teaspoonful salt

Make the filling first. Put the oleomargarine in upper half of an
oatmeal kettle, add onion and peppers, and simmer gently for
twenty minutes.

Then add the tomato halves cut into three or four pieces each and cook
twenty minutes longer. Then add salt and pepper and set over hot
water in lower half of kettle to keep hot till wanted. Now make
the

Meat Box

2 pounds uncooked beef chopped fine
1 egg unbeaten
1 teaspoonful salt
1/4 teaspoonful pepper

Work all well together. Form into a box whose sides are about an inch
thick. Place this box on a piece of oiled paper in the bottom of
a baking-pan and bake in a quick oven for thirty minutes, basting
twice with melted oleomargarine.

To serve, lift box carefully, and place on platter and pour the
filling into the center, and send at once to the table.

Beef a la Mode

Use Clod (9) or Under Round (5)

The day before the beef is to be served rub it all over with the
following, well mixed together:--

1/2 teaspoonful ground cloves
1 teaspoonful ground ginger
1/2 teaspoonful ground allspice
1/2 teaspoonful ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoonful white pepper

Then sprinkle the beef with about two tablespoonfuls vinegar and let
stand overnight. Next day put in the bottom of the roasting pan:--

1 cupful small white button onions (chopped onion will do)
1 cupful carrot cut in dice
1/2 teaspoonful celery-seed
1 bay-leaf
4 cupfuls Swift's beef extract or of stock
2 tablespoonfuls gelatine that has been soaked in cold water for
half an hour

Lay the meat on the vegetables in the pan, cover closely, and set in
an exceedingly hot oven until the meat has browned a little; then
reduce the temperature of the oven, and cook very slowly for four
hours, basting frequently.

Serve garnished with the vegetables. Make a brown sauce from the stock
left in the pan.

This is a very good way to prepare meat in warm weather, as the spices
enable it to be kept well for over a week. It is excellent served
cold with

Creamed Horseradish Sauce

4 tablespoonfuls grated horseradish with the vinegar drained off
1/4 teaspoonful salt
6 tablespoonfuls thick cream
Yolk of 1 egg

Add the salt and egg-yolk to the horseradish and mix thoroughly; whip
the cream stiff, and fold it in carefully and send at once to
table.

Boiled Beef

Use cuts from (1), (8), (9), (11)

Put the trimmings and suet of the beef into a large kettle and try
out the fat.

Remove the cracklings or scraps and into the hot fat put the meat and
turn quickly until it is red on all sides.

Cover completely with boiling water and boil rapidly for five minutes,
then turn down the gas or remove kettle to back of coal range so
that the water cannot possibly boil again, and cook fifteen
minutes to each pound of meat.

One hour before it is done add one tablespoonful salt and one-quarter
teaspoonful pepper.

When done garnish with watercress, or boiled cabbage, or vegetables.

The liquor in which the meat was boiled can be saved for soup, or made
into brown sauce to serve with it.

Left-over boiled beef may be served cold cut in thin slices, or made
into croquettes, or into meat and potato roll, or into various
warmed-over dishes.

Steak en Casserole

Use a Round Steak (5) 1 inch thick

2 pounds uncooked steak cut in pieces 2 inches square
1 cupful small white button onions
1 tablespoonful chopped parsley
1/2 cupful carrot cut in dice
1/2 cupful white turnip cut in dice
1/4 teaspoonful celery-seed
1 teaspoonful salt
1/4 teaspoonful white pepper
2 cupfuls Swift's beef extract or of stock boiling hot

Cover the bottom of the casserole with a layer of the mixed
vegetables.

Put in an iron frying-pan over the fire to heat. When hot, rub over
the bottom with a piece of Swift's Premium Oleomargarine. Lay in
the pieces of steak and brown quickly on both sides. Remove them
from the frying-pan and arrange on the vegetables in the
casserole. Cover them with the remaining vegetables. Sprinkle over
the celery-seed, salt, and pepper, and then pour the hot stock
over all. Cover the dish and bake for one hour in a quick oven.

Steak en Casserole should be sent to the table in the same dish in
which it is cooked. The steak should be brown and tender, the
vegetables slightly brown, and the stock nearly all absorbed.

the eggs. Pack all down hard in a square bread-pan so the loaf
will take the form of the pan.

Bake for two hours in a moderately quick oven, basting every fifteen
minutes with hot Swift's Beef Extract or hot stock. When done, set
away in the pan until cold.

To serve, turn out on a platter and cut in thin slices and serve with
catsup or with cream horseradish sauce. Recipe for the latter is
given under "Beef a la Mode."

Little Beef Cakes

Use any of the cheaper cuts
