will help!

[Illustration: After cooling cake thoroughly on rack, brush all the
loose crumbs away with your fingers before frosting the cake.]

[Illustration: Set one layer upside down on plate; frost top with
about ⅓ of frosting. Set other layer on top, right-side-up.]

[Illustration: Frost SIDES first, then top. Make attractive swirls
with spatula, or leave smooth for added designs.]

Choose one of our five frosting mixes to be sure of perfect
frosting—always creamy-smooth and easy-spreading!

Quick and easy Frosting tricks
_no special equipment needed!_

With a fork, spoon, spatula, or a piece of string, you can make your
frosting “fancy” ... as the simple ideas on these pages show. And with
our Betty Crocker Frosting Mixes, you can be sure of perfect
frosting—always just right to handle easily.

Use Betty Crocker Chocolate Fudge, Chocolate Malt, or Peanut Creme
Frosting Mix for these tricks:

[Illustration: Scallops—With teaspoon inverted, press tip into
frosted cake. Repeat in rows across cake for all over design.]

[Illustration: Spiral—Hold spatula at center of frosted cake.
Gradually draw spatula toward you, while turning cake.]

[Illustration: Crisscross—Draw tines of fork across cake. Repeat at
right angles to first markings. Place colorful candies in squares.]

[Illustration: Swirly squares—Draw lines through frosting with
knife. Repeat at right angles, drawing lines in opposite ways.]

The Frosting on the cake shows you care

Your Decorating Set

Many different decorating tips are available—but these basic 5 will make
all the glamor cakes shown in this book. If you have a set, select these
tips by their numbers. Or you can get this basic set for $1.00 ... see
details on p. 23.

[Illustration: #4 writing tip ... used for writing, lattice designs,
and other delicate patterns.]

[Illustration: #28 star tip ... used for smaller borders, simple
flowers, and fancy letters.]

[Illustration: #104 petal tip ... makes petals for roses and other
flowers, also flat ribbons and borders.]

[Illustration: #68 leaf tip ... makes leaves, long petals, delicate
lace borders, and edgings.]

[Illustration: #96 flower tip ... makes many flowers like rosettes
by a simple twist of the cone.]

Betty Crocker Fluffy White Frosting Mix
makes a wonderful can’t-fail Decorator Icing

No need to make up a special separate batch of icing to decorate your
cake! One package makes plenty to frost your cake and decorate it, too:

To 1 cup prepared Fluffy White Frosting...

Blend in 1 to 1½ cups _sifted_ confectioners’ sugar (add a little at a
time until frosting is stiff enough to hold its shape)....

Blend in 1 tbsp. soft butter and a dash of salt.

Note: Increase sugar and butter when using more than 1 cup frosting.

_Is it thick enough? Is it thin enough?_ Try a little with the tip you
plan to use. If too thin, blend in a little more confectioners’ sugar.
If too thick, blend in a drop or two of water.

HOW TO USE YOUR CONE

[Illustration: 1 Fit tip tightly into cone with one finger. Fill
about half full. Fold top to keep icing in.]

[Illustration: 2 Hold near top of cone. Use other hand to guide tip.
For most work, hold cone at 45° angle.]

[Illustration: 3 For drop flowers and rosettes, hold cone straight
up and down. Press out icing, twist cone, and release.]

Try out your decorator set with our
CROSS-STITCH CAKE

Here is a simple-to-start with cake that lets you have fun trying out
all the decorator tips.

Tip: have an inverted cake pan handy, to try a few practice strokes on
the back. Afterwards, you can scrape the frosting off the pan and put it
back in your cone.

for center of rose.]

one side of center. Add two more petals, forming triangle. Add
petals, overlapping.]

[Illustration: 3 Remove rose from nail with kitchen shears ... cut
almost through base of rose, place on cake, cut completely through,
ease rose off.]

[Illustration: A perfect cake deserves a perfect Frosting]
