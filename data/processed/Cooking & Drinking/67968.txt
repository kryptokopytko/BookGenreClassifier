How to use the COLD-CONTROL

[Illustration]

Under normal conditions, your Frigidaire refrigerator will
automatically provide the right temperature for keeping foods good to
eat. However, for special purposes, temperatures which are lower than
normal may be required. These are described below. The Cold-Control
is located at the upper right hand corner of the food compartment. To
change the setting of the Cold-Control, simply turn towards you for
colder temperatures, away from you for warmer temperatures.

=For normal use=--Leave the Cold-Control on Number “1”. Even in
hot summer weather this setting will be satisfactory because your
Frigidaire refrigerator automatically adjusts itself for changes in
kitchen temperatures.

=For fast ice freezing=--Set the Cold-Control on Number “7”. This
provides fast freezing. After the ice has frozen, turn the Cold-Control
back to its normal setting.

=For freezing desserts, salads and other foods=--Set the Cold-Control
on Number “7,” until dessert or salad has frozen to the desired
consistency. Then turn back to Number “3” or “4.” This will keep it
at the proper temperature. Package foods to be frozen according to
suggestions on page 8.

=For keeping frozen foods=--When you keep commercially frozen foods or
commercial ice cream in the Super-Freezer, leave the Cold-Control on
Number “3” or “4” as long as the foods are to be kept frozen. To thaw
foods, place packages on one of the food compartment shelves for 24 to
48 hours. Remove entirely from the refrigerator for fast thawing.

=Vacation Setting=--When you’re away from home for a number of days and
foods are to remain in your refrigerator, set the control on one of the
economy positions “A,” “B,” or “C.” This will maintain a satisfactory
temperature because the cabinet door will not be opened, and no warm
foods will be placed in the food compartment. If no foods are to remain
in the refrigerator, remove the electrical cord from the outlet,
remove all foods and ice trays, and leave door open. This allows food
compartment to air out.

How and when to DEFROST

[Illustration]

It is normal for frost to build up on the Super-Freezer. This comes
from moisture in the air that enters the food compartment when the
door is opened. When this moisture strikes the cold surface of the
Super-Freezer, it turns to frost. Removing the frost periodically keeps
operating costs low.

=When to remove frost=--The speed with which frost builds up depends
upon the amount of moisture in the air and how many times you open the
refrigerator door. When the frost builds up to about ¹⁄₄ inch, or the
_thickness_ of a pencil, it should be removed by one of the methods
below.

Defrost the FAST way when storing frozen foods

When you are keeping frozen foods, it is important to defrost as
rapidly as possible so that frozen foods can be returned to the
Super-Freezer before they have had a chance to thaw out. Proceed as
follows:

=1.= Remove frozen foods from freezer and wrap them in several
thicknesses of newspaper. Place them in some cool spot in the kitchen.

=2.= Remove all trays from the freezer. Remove all foods from Cold
Storage Tray located beneath the freezer.

=3.= Turn the Cold-Control to “Off”.

=4.= Place a pan of hot water in the freezer. An ice tray may be used
for this purpose but the water should then be warm _not HOT_ as hot
water may damage the waxed surface of the trays.

=5.= As the frost begins to melt, it will drop into the Cold Storage
Tray. DO NOT USE ANY SHARP INSTRUMENT TO REMOVE FROST.

=6.= When all frost has melted and has been disposed of, reset the
Cold-Control to “4”, wash the Cold Storage Tray, place it back in
position and return foods to freezer.

Regular Defrosting

When foods are not being kept in the Super-Freezer, this slower method
may be used:

=1.= Follow step “2” above.

=2.= Set Cold-Control to ‘Defrost’ and leave in this position
overnight, or until all frost has melted.

=3.= Follow step “6” above.

NOTE: The best time to clean your refrigerator is while it is being
defrosted. See page 10 for cleaning instructions.

=Important Note=: Not all features shown in illustration
above are provided in every model.]

How and Where to Keep Foods

=Frozen Foods=
Place in Super-Freezer directly on freezer shelf or in Meat-Tender.
See page 8 for information on freezing foods.

=Milk and Tall Bottles=
Store on shelf on either side of Super-Freezer. Put milk in
your refrigerator as soon after delivery as possible.

=Meats and Poultry=
Meats and Poultry to be kept more than a few days, keep
best when frozen. See page 8. Poultry should be thoroughly
washed and dressed, then placed in Meat-Tender.
Smoked meats may be kept in the Meat-Tender for as
long as two weeks. Fish should always be kept frozen in
the Super-Freezer. Meats and Poultry to be kept for short
periods may be stored in the Cold Storage Tray.

=Regular Foods=
Butter, leftovers and other foods subject to drying out,
should be stored in covered containers on any convenient
shelf. Cheese should be wrapped in waxed paper for short-time
storage, or in moisture-vapor-proof material for longer
storage. Eggs should never be washed before placing in refrigerator,
as this removes their protective coating.

=Leafy Vegetables=
Trim, discard undesirable portions, wash thoroughly with
cold water and store in Hydrator. Lettuce, celery and similar
vegetables keep better if stalks and heads are not cut up or
portioned. Carrots, radishes, beets, etc., should be trimmed,
washed, drained and placed in Hydrator. Tomatoes, peppers,
and cucumbers should be washed and wiped dry before
placing in Hydrator. Asparagus and Brussel sprouts should
not be washed until prepared for cooking. They may be
placed on any convenient shelf of your refrigerator.

=Fruits=
Oranges, apples, lemons, grapefruit, grapes, etc., should
be stored in the Hydrator.

How to FREEZE FOODS

[Illustration: · _See page 4 for use of Cold-Control when freezing
foods or storing frozen foods, desserts or salads._]

=Freeze foods for longer storage--=

Foods that are to be kept for more than a few days--especially meats
and leftovers--keep better frozen. Many other types of foods may also
be frozen successfully. These include fruits and vegetables, poultry,
cooked foods, even cakes, pies and other baked goods!

=Correct wrapping for freezing--=

Foods to be frozen should be wrapped or packaged in waxed paper if
to be stored for few days. For longer periods use materials made
especially for home freezing. Wrap carefully, as illustrated above,
being sure to exclude all air.

=Using frozen foods--=

Frozen meats may be cooked from the frozen state or thawed before
cooking. If cooked from the frozen state allow extra cooking time. Cook
meats at low temperature. Use a meat thermometer with roasts and other
large cuts for best results. Frozen vegetables should be cooked from
the frozen state. Some pre-cooked frozen foods should be thawed before
warming. Fruits are often served while still partially frozen. For
cooking commercial frozen foods follow instructions on package.

Keeping commercially frozen foods

Commercial frozen foods may be kept for several weeks by placing them
in the Super-Freezer in direct contact with the top or bottom freezer
shelf. Follow instructions on the package for thawing or cooking.
Frozen foods once thawed should not be refrozen.

Commercial ice creams keep best when removed from packages and placed
in one of the Quickube Trays in the Super-Freezer.

[Illustration]

How to use your QUICKUBE ice trays

=To remove trays--=

Pull the tray handle downward. This will release the most stubborn tray.

=To remove cubes--=

Place one hand on top of the tray, lift tray release lever with other
hand. This will release cubes, two or a trayful as desired.

[Illustration]

Fill trays only two-thirds full of water. Keep on hand only as
many trays of ice as will actually be needed. Use the rest of
the Super-Freezer space for frozen desserts or frozen foods. The
double-width tray is especially valuable for making larger quantities
of salads and desserts.

Facts about the METER-MISER

What the Meter-Miser is

The Meter-Miser is the heart of your Frigidaire refrigerator. It is
an exclusive Frigidaire feature--quiet, simple, trouble-free. The
Meter-Miser Compressor has two simple parts that move--so economical,
it uses no more current than an ordinary light bulb. The Meter-Miser
and the entire sealed-in mechanical system of your Frigidaire is
protected by a 5-year Protection Plan which is covered on page 23.

Oiling

You never have to oil the Meter-Miser. A lifetime supply is sealed-in
at the time of manufacture and never needs changing or replenishing.

If You Should Move

Before moving, the Meter-Miser should be securely locked in place by
tightening down completely the shipping nuts shown by arrows in the
illustration below. These nuts should be loosened before your Frigidaire
refrigerator is again put in operation.

[Illustration]

Location in Room

The closer any refrigerator is placed to a source of heat, the more
current it will use. If possible, locate your refrigerator away from
any source of extreme heat or cold.

How to Keep Your Frigidaire Refrigerator Looking Like New

Cabinet Exterior

Wipe with a damp cloth. For more thorough cleaning use a damp, soapy
cloth. Then rinse and dry well. For stubborn stains on Dulux-finished
cabinets, use Frigidaire Dulux Surface Renewer[A]--or Frigidaire
Porcelain Speed Cleaner[A] for porcelain finished exteriors. Do not use
strong gritty soaps, scouring powders or acids.

Quickube Trays

Wash with soap or warm water--NEVER hot water. Do not use metal sponges
or scouring powders as these may damage the tray surface and make ice
cubes difficult to remove.

Other Interior Equipment

Use a solution of one teaspoonful of soda to a quart of warm water.
Rinse with clear water.

Rubber Door Seal

Use water or Frigidaire Nu-Coat[A].

[A] _Dulux Surface Renewer, Porcelain Speed Cleaner and Nu-Coat may be
obtained from your Frigidaire Dealer._

HELPFUL HINTS--about frozen desserts

· No longer is it necessary to use whipping cream or prepare a custard
in order to make a dessert with an exceptionally fine texture. _Tasty,
inexpensive desserts can be made with coffee cream--with half coffee
cream and half milk--or even with milk alone._

In making these desserts there are certain points that must be
observed. Complete information is given with each recipe.

Use of coffee cream

Coffee cream may be used in place of whipping cream in many frozen
desserts by the following method. Substitute an equal amount of coffee
cream for the combined quantities of whipping and coffee creams
indicated in the recipe. After the first mixture of ingredients has
been chilled, add the coffee cream and place in Frigidaire freezing
tray until firmly frozen. Then remove the contents of the tray to a
very cold mixing bowl and whip with an electric or hand beater until
the mixture becomes light and creamy. Return to freezing tray and allow
to finish freezing without further agitation.

Coffee cream usually contains 18 or 20 per cent butterfat. It can
be used in place of whipping cream for garnishing desserts by first
pouring into the freezing tray and allowing it to freeze before
whipping. After whipping, place in the freezing tray for additional
freezing in order to hold it in proper consistency until serving time.

Freezing method

Your Frigidaire refrigerator has the Cold-Control to speed up freezing.
The directions for using it should be followed.

The best method is to set the Cold-Control at the coldest position
approximately one-half hour before placing the mixture in the freezer
for freezing. This assures colder temperatures in the freezing
compartment, which results in faster freezing and better desserts.
After the mixture is completely frozen, the Cold-Control should be
set at an intermediate position to keep the dessert in the proper
consistency until serving time. _Important Note: Please see page 4 for
use of Cold-Control._

Mellowing improves desserts

All desserts, regardless of kind or the time required for freezing,
are much improved in flavor and texture by allowing them to mellow.
Especially is this true for fruit creams, fruit salads and similar
combinations. This is accomplished by allowing the dessert to remain
in the freezing compartment at a higher temperature than that at which
it is frozen for some time before it is served. This temperature is
obtained by setting the Cold-Control at an intermediate position, as
described on page 4.

To avoid buttery taste

A buttery taste in frozen deserts is usually caused by one of two
things. Either the cream has been over-whipped or it is too rich in
butterfat. The butterfat content of whipping cream varies greatly in
different states. In certain localities whipping cream will contain as
high as 40 per cent butterfat, making it too rich for a frozen dessert.
In this case, it should be diluted with coffee cream or milk. The
standard butterfat content for whipping cream is 28 per cent. However,
it is possible to whip cream containing only 20 per cent butterfat if
it is first poured into the freezing tray and allowed to chill to the
freezing point.

_Frigidaire Frozen Creams_

· A great variety of delicious frozen creams can be made in the
freezing trays of your refrigerator. It’s no trick to make them and
by trying some of the following recipes you will find that tasty,
inexpensive desserts can be made without whipping cream.

Remember that proper temperatures for freezing desserts are just as
important as the recipe itself in obtaining the best results.

stirring constantly. Cook in double boiler 25 minutes or, if you have
an electric range, use saucepan on LOW or SIMMER heat. If time will
permit, cooking for one hour greatly improves the flavor and will make
for a better texture in the frozen dessert. Stir several times during
cooking process. Combine with well-beaten egg yolks. Cook for five
minutes or until thick, stirring constantly. Cool, add salt, cream.
Pour into freezing tray. When frozen remove to bowl, add vanilla, and

_Frigidaire Novelty Desserts_

=Mousses= retain their popularity because they are so simply and easily
prepared. Whipped cream forms the base of these desserts and stirring
is unnecessary during the freezing process.

=Parfaits= are rightly regarded as a very rich delicacy. They are
served only when the occasion calls for something very attractive and
when calories can be disregarded. The parfait itself is very easily
prepared and the same method of preparation is applicable to each
recipe. Parfaits are most acceptable when served with strawberries,
raspberries or other fruit. However, flavored syrups with nuts are very
good substitutes--garnishing with maraschino cherries when desired.

=Novelty Desserts=--Many times you will want to serve something just a
little different; maybe a special dinner dessert, afternoon or evening
refreshments, or that “dessert bridge” you have been planning for
some time. On these pages are a number of suggestions to help you in
planning for these occasions.

Apricot Mousse

_ten or twelve servings_

1 large can apricots or 2¹⁄₄ cups apricot pulp
2 egg whites
1¹⁄₂ cups cream, whipped
¹⁄₂ cup sugar

Drain the contents of can of apricots and force through a sieve. There
should be 2¹⁄₄ cups of apricot pulp. Place in freezing tray and allow
to remain for 45 minutes. Remove from the tray and turn into a bowl
containing the unbeaten egg whites. Beat until light and fluffy. Whip
cream, gradually adding sugar. Fold the cream into the beaten apricots
and eggs. Return to the tray and freeze without stirring.

Strawberry Mousse

_ten servings_

1 pint strawberries
1 cup granulated sugar
2 teaspoons lemon juice
2 cups whipping cream
2 egg whites
¹⁄₁₆ teaspoon salt

Wash and stem berries. Add sugar and crush. Heat until sugar is
dissolved. Strain and chill. Add lemon juice to berry mixture. Fold
in whipped cream and stiffly beaten egg whites to which salt has been
added. Pour into freezing tray, molds or individual cups. Freeze
without stirring. See page 4 for use of Cold-Control. This dessert is
very attractive when frozen in silver cups, and decorated with whipped
cream or whole, fresh berries.

Butterscotch Parfait

_ten to twelve servings_

²⁄₃ cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons butter
¹⁄₂ cup water
4 egg yolks
1 pint whipping cream
¹⁄₁₆ teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons vanilla

Combine sugar and butter. Heat until melted. Cook for one minute. Add
water; cook until butterscotch is melted. Add syrup mixture slowly to
beaten egg yolks. Cook in double boiler until light and fluffy. If
you have an electric range, cook in saucepan on LOW or SIMMER heat.
Chill. Add whipped cream, salt, and vanilla. Pour into freezing tray
or individual cups. Freeze without stirring. Chopped nuts may also be
added. See page 4 for use of Cold-Control.

Frozen Crumb Cake

_four to six servings_

1 cup whipping cream
2 cups sponge cake broken in small portions (Any left-over cake can
be used. Angel food cake is delicious served in this manner)
¹⁄₄ cup chopped English walnuts

Whip cream and combine with cake. This should be tossed together with
a fork. Add chopped nuts and pour into freezing tray. Freeze without
stirring. Slice for serving.

Fruit may be added to the above recipe if desired, either frozen
with the cake or chilled and served with the frozen cake. Maraschino
cherries may be added. This is an excellent way of using those unused
portions of cake and small portions of fruit.

Chocolate Cookie Dessert

_six to eight servings_

18 thin chocolate cookies (1¹⁄₂ inches in diameter)
1 pint whipping cream
2 teaspoons vanilla

Whip cream and add vanilla. Spread one tablespoon on one cookie and
press another on top. After four or five cookies have been added,
lay the stack on edge lengthwise in the center of the freezing tray;
complete the roll; then completely cover with remainder of whipped
cream. Place in Frigidaire on a shelf for several hours, allowing
cookies to absorb some of the moisture from the cream. Garnish with
maraschino cherries or chocolate shot. Place in freezing compartment
and allow to thoroughly chill or freeze. When freezing, please see page
4 for use of Cold-Control. Serve in diagonal slices and add a small
portion of chocolate sauce to each serving.

_Variation_: Ginger cookies may be used the same as chocolate cookies,
and served without chocolate sauce.

Chocolate Bavarian Cream

_ten servings_

1 tablespoon gelatine
¹⁄₄ cup cold water
1¹⁄₂ squares chocolate
²⁄₃ cup sugar
¹⁄₁₆ teaspoon salt
¹⁄₂ cup hot milk
1 pint whipping cream
1 teaspoon vanilla
6 lady fingers

Soak gelatine in cold water. Melt chocolate in top of double boiler
and add sugar, salt, and hot milk. If you have an electric range, use
saucepan on LOW or SIMMER heat. Cook for a few minutes. Add gelatine
to hot chocolate mixture. Cool until it begins to thicken. Beat with
beater until mixture becomes very light. Fold in whipped cream. Add
vanilla. Line a mold with lady fingers. Pour in cream mixture. Place in
Frigidaire freezer to chill. When dessert has set, remove to a plate
and decorate with whipped cream before serving.

Angel Parfait

_eight to ten servings_

¹⁄₄ cup water
1 cup sugar
2 egg whites
¹⁄₁₆ teaspoon salt

(236° F.). Combine slowly with stiffly beaten egg whites to which salt
has been added. Continue to beat until thick. Cool. Add vanilla;
combine with the chilled whipped cream. Pour into Frigidaire freezing
tray. Freeze without stirring. See page 4 for use of Cold-Control.

This should be served with crushed fruit. When served in parfait
glasses, add whipped cream and garnish with grapes, preserved cherries,
or other fruit.

Maple Parfait

_eight to ten servings_

³⁄₄ cup maple syrup
3 eggs, separated
1¹⁄₂ cups whipping cream
¹⁄₁₆ teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla

Heat syrup in double boiler, or, if you have an electric range, merely
use saucepan on LOW or SIMMER heat. Add syrup slowly to well-beaten
egg yolks and cook for several minutes on LOW or SIMMER heat, or in
a double boiler. Beat with a rotary beater. Pour into stiffly beaten
egg whites. Chill thoroughly. Add whipped cream, salt, and vanilla
to custard. Add a few drops of maple extract if a stronger flavor is
