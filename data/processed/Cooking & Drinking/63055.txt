gel it! in style

Here is your guide to new style in cooking, adding form to dishes,
setting off flavors, colors and textures to your taste—and in new quick
time, too. Amazing? Read on.

You’ll find easy ways to chill a shapely salad, “bake” a handsome
refrigerator cake or pie, mold a spectacular dessert or heap it high in
a serving dish. As you cook your way through these pages, you’ll find
that you have mastered more than one dish at a time. These recipes are
patterns as convenient as a basic dress; you can vary them your
individual way. Choose the foods and flavors you prefer or have on hand,
and gel them in style—_your_ style.

What is gelatine? Unflavored gelatine is colorless, odorless, and
tasteless. Knox Gelatine is a granulated protein substance derived from
the long bones of cattle. It is pure protein consisting of 17 amino
acids ... among them 7 out of the 8 essential to good diet.
(Commercially flavored gelatines, on the other hand, consist of ⅞ sugar
and flavorings and only ⅛ gelatine.) Unflavored gelatine takes on the
flavors and colors you choose, when combined in dishes to your taste.
For extra style in a dish, gel it!

{quick-gel} new 30-minute gel!

Now you can cook the modern way—fast!—with gelatine. The new quick-gel
method takes advantage of modern refrigeration and food products, to
prepare gelatine dishes that are ready to serve minutes after you stir
them together! After gelatine is softened, then dissolved in hot liquid,
add frozen juices, fruits or soups, ice cream or ice cubes as part of
the liquid. The frozen food or cubes will melt and quick-chill the
gelatine, resulting in gels within half an hour! You’ll find new
quick-gel recipes throughout this booklet.

easy guide to gel cookery
cooking with gelatine is as easy as 1-2-3.

1 An envelope of gelatine will gel 1 pint of liquid. First, choose the
liquid you will use—water, juice, broth, milk or other as
designated in recipes which follow. Sprinkle gelatine from the
envelope over ½ cup of cold liquid and let stand a few minutes to
soften. If sugar is to be added, stir sugar with the gelatine
before you begin. (If 1 tablespoon or more of sugar is added, the
gelatine-sugar mixture may be softened and dissolved directly in
hot liquid.)

2 Stir softened gelatine over medium heat until mixture is clear and
gelatine dissolved, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and add
remaining liquid or, for new quick-gel method, add frozen juice,
fruit, etc.

3 Pour into mold or serving dish, chill until set. This takes 2 to 4
hours, or may be cut down to ½ hour or less when made the new
quick-gel way. Smaller molds set faster.

gels clear and airy

When gelatine is dissolved in a clear liquid it makes a shimmering clear
gel, with smooth texture. Gels are delicious plain, or you may add
contrast by incorporating solids before the gel is completely set. Or
turn out light and frothy dishes by incorporating air. For a whip,
simply beat any partially set gelatine with a rotary beater, then chill.
Or, add beaten egg whites, whipped cream or whipped evaporated milk, or
such ready-beaten mixtures as mayonnaise and ice cream to make mousses,
creamy molds, and other specialties. Tips to make this easy:

how to beat...

At a slightly thickened consistency, clear gelatine can be turned into
an airy, frothy mixture. Whip the gelatine with rotary or electric
beater until it is light and fluffy, then chill firm. Or add egg whites
and beat all together to make an especially frothy “snow.” (See page 6
for recipes.)

how to set...

To set gelatine, just put the mold in the refrigerator. To add solids,
chill gelatine mixture until slightly thickened, to prevent solids from
rising to the top or sinking to the bottom. When gelatine mixture
reaches the consistency of unbeaten egg white, you can fold in cut-up
drained fruits, vegetables, meats or other solids, whipped milk
(evaporated or nonfat solids) or cream. Then chill.

For an extra-fast set, first put mold in the freezer for 5 minutes. Or,
put bowl or pan of gelatine mixture into a container of ice and water
and stir mixture for 5 minutes, until it begins to thicken. Then chill
in refrigerator.

how to unmold...

Dip mold briefly into warm (not hot!) water just to level of gelatine
mixture. Run the tip of a knife around edge of gelatine. Rinse a serving
plate in cold water (makes it easier to slide mold to center of plate),
place plate on top of the mold, invert plate and mold together, and
shake gently to loosen gelatine. Lift off mold, slide gelatine into
place in center of plate. Presto! A snack or main dish, salad or dessert
with form and style!

{D}essert magic

Dessert is often the star of the meal—and you can quickly learn to
select a superb dessert recipe first, then plan a meal which will lead
up to your grand finale.

As you begin to prepare and serve meals, it may seem you need some magic
power to have all dishes and courses ready to serve at the right time. A
gelatine dessert can be your abra-cadabra—prepare it ahead, have it
ready in the refrigerator at serving time.

This advance preparation need no longer require hours of chilling! With
new quick-gel ways of preparing gelatine desserts with frozen foods such
as juices, ice cream and frozen fruits, you can stir together a quick
fruit mold or a berry-cream pie and have it ready to unmold or slice and
serve within minutes! Gelatine captures the full flavor of these
refreshing foods, makes it easier than ever to serve a special dessert.

In selecting a dessert, remember—dessert should complete the meal in a
complementary, contrasting way. Dessert should be light and refreshing
after a lengthy, filling meal; it can be hearty and satisfying when the
meal before has been light. Unflavored gelatine takes on your favorite
flavor in any type of dessert, from feather-weight snows and whips to
rich, creamy pies and cakes.

a {G}el can be many desserts

Here are pattern recipes you can prepare to your taste. Make the
traditional Simple Fruit Gel in your favorite fruit flavor, or the new

patterns:

in freezer until serving time. Especially delicious with orange, grape
