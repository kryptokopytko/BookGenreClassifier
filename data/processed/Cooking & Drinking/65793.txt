FROSTY BEVERAGES

[Illustration: With your International Harvester Refrigerator to
provide you with a generous supply of ice cubes, you will be serving
many cooling, colorful beverages in the summer time. Here are some
suggestions for making these mid-afternoon and evening pick-ups
especially refreshing.]

ICE CUBES FOR COLD DRINKS

Use either crushed or whole cubes. Crushed ice cools beverages more
quickly; cubes last longer and add a pleasant tinkle.

FANCY ICE CUBES

Freeze curls of lemon or orange peel, maraschino cherries with stems, or
sprigs of mint, a raspberry or strawberry in ice cubes.

Freeze leftover fruit drinks in the ice-cube trays to serve in iced tea
or other beverages.

For fancy cubes, freeze the cubes slowly to prevent cloudiness and
expansion. If fruit is to be frozen in the cube, fill tray ⅓ full of
liquid, partially freeze and add fruit. Allow to freeze into position.
Add water to within ¼ inch of top of tray and finish freezing.

Freeze punch in cubes or in a block—ideal for chilling the punch bowl
and cooling the beverage. Children will love these frozen cubes of sweet
fruit flavor if sticks are inserted in the mixture when nearly frozen so
they will resemble frozen suckers.

TO FROST RIMS OF GLASSES

Put lemon juice into a shallow dish. Sift superfine granulated or
powdered sugar onto a plate—about ¼ inch deep. Invert each glass in the
lemon juice. Lift out of juice, place into the sugar for a minute. Lift
carefully out of the sugar so as not to jar the sugar coating which has
formed on the rim. Place in the refrigerator until “set.” Fill glasses
with the beverage, being careful not to disturb the frost.

USE OF SYRUPS

Keep several kinds of syrups on hand in your refrigerator. Leftover
syrup from canned fruit makes a delicious base for chilled fruit
beverages.

PLAIN SUGAR SYRUP

1 cup sugar
1 cup water

Combine sugar and water, boil 5 minutes, cool and store in refrigerator;
can be used for iced tea and fruit drinks.

CHOCOLATE SYRUP

½ cup cocoa or 2 squares unsweetened chocolate
1 cup sugar
1 cup water
⅛ teaspoon salt
1½ teaspoons vanilla

Combine cocoa, sugar, water and cook over low heat about 5 minutes, or
until thickened. Cool. Add salt and vanilla. Store in refrigerator.
Chocolate syrup is ideal for milk drinks.

PUNCH-TEA BASE

2 teaspoons tea
2 cups boiling water
1 cup sugar
1 cup orange juice
½ cup lemon juice
½ cup cold water
1 quart chilled ginger ale

Pour boiling water over tea. Cover and allow to stand 3 minutes. Strain
over sugar. Stir until sugar is dissolved. Cool. Add orange and lemon
juices and cold water. Ice well. Add ginger ale just before serving
punch. Base can be stored in refrigerator for later use. Yield: 10 to 12
servings.

Frozen Desserts

[Illustration: You can easily make delicious, smooth-textured frozen
desserts in your International Harvester refrigerator. And you can
add variations of your own choice. Fruits in season add a luscious
taste as do flavors such as chocolate, coffee, maple, caramel,
marshmallow or nuts. Having a supply of ice cream variations on hand
in your refrigerator will be a convenience and will provide tempting
treats for you and your family.]

ICE CREAM

Ice cream frozen in a household refrigerator usually employs special
ingredients such as whole eggs, egg yolks, gelatin, corn syrup, flour or
cornstarch, or hot syrup poured over egg yolks or whites to counteract
the formation of ice crystals. These ingredients add body and richness
and contribute to the smoothness by producing finer ice crystals. They
also increase the amount of air that can be incorporated, resulting in a
greater volume. Combinations that are too sweet will not freeze firm in
a refrigerator. A good proportion is 1 part sugar to 4 parts liquid.

To freeze ice cream, set the cold control for fast freezing (coldest
position). Pour the mixture into the tray and place it on the bottom of
the freezing compartment in contact with the refrigerated surface.
Freeze until firm throughout. Remove the frozen mixture from the tray to
a chilled bowl and break up the mixture with wooden spoon (a wooden
spoon does not conduct heat from the hand as a metal one does). Work
quickly. Beat with an electric mixer or a rotary beater until mass is
free of hard lumps. Gently fold in egg whites or whipped cream. Return
the mixture at once to the tray and place it in the freezing
compartment. Moisten the bottom of tray to insure good contact and to
hasten freezing. When frozen, reset cold control at midway between
normal and coldest point to mellow ice cream until time to serve.

Chilled Desserts

There are many delectable desserts made from a gelatin base. These are
usually called Whips, Snows, or Creams, according to the fruit
combination, such as Cherry Whip, Grape Snow, or Pineapple Bavarian
Cream. Other desserts which have eye and taste appeal are combinations
of fruit, gelatin or cream fillings plus cake or cookie foundation.
Again, these are ideal ways to use the last of the angel food, sponge or
plain cake or extend a small amount of a food to fit your current needs.

Snow puddings attain a characteristic light, airy texture through the
addition of beaten egg whites which are folded in when the gelatin
mixture begins to set. The same holds true of Bavarian creams except
that whipped cream takes the place of the egg whites.

To use plain gelatin as a base, soften gelatin in a small amount of cold
liquid. Stir into the hot liquid. For general use, allow 1 envelope of
gelatin to 2 cups of liquid. If acid fruit juices are used, the
proportion of 1 envelope of gelatin to 1¾ cups liquid is more
satisfactory. To hasten setting of gelatin mixtures and to preserve the
fresh fruit flavors, heat only half of the liquid to dissolve the
softened gelatin. Then add the other half cold. _Note_: Fresh pineapple
juice or pulp must be scalded before using with gelatin because of an
enzyme in fresh pineapple that keeps gelatin from jelling.

To remove molded gelatin desserts, dip mold into a pan of warm (not hot)
water for about 30 seconds. The water should come almost to the top of
the mold. Then dessert can be removed easily to the serving plate by
inverting mold on the plate. Turn mold over carefully and dessert will
remain on plate; this action is done in the same manner as one removes a
cake from the pan.

ORANGE-BANANA CAKE

_Salads_

[Illustration: The secret of a successful salad is thorough chilling
and crisping of all ingredients. Salad greens should be thoroughly
cleaned and dried; fruits well drained; meat, fish and cheese cut
into bite-size pieces of uniform shape. Eye-appeal is important. Add
colorful garnishes to a salad that is not naturally colorful.

Salads for the main course should contain some protein-rich foods,
such as chicken, meat, fish, or cheese, and vegetables. Marinate
meat or vegetables separately in a tart French dressing and combine
just before serving. Mayonnaise or cooked dressings give added food
value and body to salads of this kind. For meat, chicken or fish
salads, allow ½ cup ingredients and 2 tablespoons dressing per
serving. The salad will be more attractive if the pieces are large
enough to be identified.]

MIXED GREEN SALAD: A green salad served before, after or with a hearty
main course should be light and tangy, the servings should be small, and
the dressing tart. Greens can include lettuce, chicory, romaine, water
cress or endive. Other raw vegetables can be added, such as tomatoes,
radishes, onions, cucumbers, carrots, beets, spinach leaves, turnips,
and cauliflower or broccoli flowerettes.

SALAD TACTICS: When choosing the dressing to accompany the salad,
remember a safe rule to follow is simple dressings for accompaniment
salads, hearty dressings for main-course salads and sweet dressings for
dessert salads. Too much dressing can ruin a salad. It is best to season
salads lightly and provide additional dressing on the side.

Dip fruits that darken in lemon juice. Pieces of fruit should be large
enough so they can be identified. Many of the smaller fruits and berries
can be left whole or halved. Allow ½ cup fruit per serving. Handle salad
foods lightly. Do not mix excessively, or packing and bruising may
result. Keep salads in the refrigerator until ready to serve. Long
waiting in room temperature causes them to lose their crispness. It is
good practice to chill the salad plates in your refrigerator before
serving the salad. This applies especially to fruit and gelatin salads.

MOLDED SALADS: Before using the mold or molds when making gelatin
salads, rinse them in cold water. Leave excess moisture on the molds, or
brush molds lightly with salad oil. If square sided molds are used they
can be lined with strips of cellophane. If individual molds are not
available, small muffin pans will serve as a convenient substitute, or
pour the mixture into an ice cube tray with the metal grid in position.
Place the tray on the food compartment shelf until salad sets. A plain
gelatin base or a flavored base may be used for the salad. Your choice
depends upon the other ingredients that make up the salad.

_Refrigerator Cookies_

[Illustration: Crisp, crunchy, delightfully fresh cookies at a
moment’s notice are at your fingertips when your International
Harvester Refrigerator holds an ever-ready supply of refrigerator
cookie dough. Refrigerator cookie dough keeps well in your
refrigerator for several weeks. When ready to bake cookies, merely
cut off thin slices of dough and bake as directed. Re-wrap and
return remaining dough to your refrigerator.]

_Refrigerator Rolls_

[Illustration: It is a particular advantage to have refrigerated
dough for fresh rolls when entertaining or if the family is small
and cannot use a full recipe at one time. Almost any yeast roll may
be refrigerated three or four days satisfactorily. However, the
recipe should contain plenty of yeast and sugar. When ready to use,
the dough can be formed into rolls of any desired shape or into
coffee cake. Refrigerating the dough at from 40°F. to 50°F. retards
yeast activity. The surface of the dough must be greased and covered
tightly to prevent drying or the formation of a hard crust.]

REFRIGERATOR ROLLS

¾ cup milk
6 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon salt
5 tablespoons shortening
½ cup warm water
2 cakes yeast
1 egg
4½ cups sifted flour

Scald milk. Add sugar, salt, shortening and stir. Cool this mixture
until lukewarm. Soften yeast cakes in warm water and let stand until
dissolved. Stir and add lukewarm milk mixture. Add beaten egg and 2 cups
flour, beat until smooth. Add remaining flour and mix well. Place dough
in a lightly greased bowl and brush top with melted shortening. Cover
and store in refrigerator, at least 2 hours. When ready to use, punch
dough down and cut off as much dough as desired. Form rolls and place in
greased muffin pans. Brush with melted butter, cover and let rise in a
warm place until doubled in bulk. Bake in hot oven (425°F.) about 15
minutes. Makes about 2 dozen rolls.

FOUNDATION SWEET DOUGH

2 cakes yeast
¼ cup lukewarm water
1 cup milk
¼ cup butter
½ cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon grated lemon rind (if desired)
5 cups sifted flour (about)

Soften yeast in lukewarm water. Scald milk. Add butter, sugar and salt
and cool to lukewarm. Add 2 cups flour and beat well. Add yeast, eggs
and lemon rind. Blend thoroughly. Add remaining flour to make a soft
dough. Turn out on lightly floured board and knead until satiny. Place
in a greased bowl, cover and let rise in warm place (80° to 85°F.) until
doubled in bulk. Punch down and form into smooth ball. Grease surface
lightly, cover and put into refrigerator. To use, remove dough from
refrigerator and punch down. Mold at once into rolls, tea rings or
coffee cakes, or if preferred, let dough stand in warm room for an hour,
punch down and mold. Place in greased pans and let rise until doubled in
bulk. Bake in moderate oven (375°F.) 20 to 25 minutes for rolls, 25 to
30 minutes for coffee cakes. Yield: about 3½ dozen rolls or two 12-inch
tea rings.

_Casserole Dishes_

[Illustration: Colorful, tasty, all-in-one dishes—casseroles—are
ideal as the main dish for luncheon or supper. They are the solution
to clever disguising of left-over foods. They are the answer to
time-saving, before-hand meal preparation. The casserole dish can be
prepared several hours in advance, refrigerated, and later placed in
the oven so as to be piping hot by meal time.

As a rule, casserole dishes are made up of various combinations of a
protein food, a starch, a vegetable, and a sauce. The sauce is
either white sauce, plain or varied, or a cream soup. The starch may
be noodles, spaghetti, macaroni, crackers, potatoes or potato chips,
bread crumbs or a cereal. The protein food may be meat, fish,
poultry or cheese. Often the vegetables and protein foods are
leftovers which are cleverly combined to appear dressed-up in a new
attire.

For the majority of casserole dishes, a medium white sauce is the
right consistency—the proportions being 2 tablespoons butter to 2
tablespoons flour, ½ teaspoon salt, few grains pepper, and 1 cup
milk. Thin sauce can be made by using 1 tablespoon butter and 1
tablespoon flour to 1 cup milk.]

VARIATIONS: Added zest enhancing the flavor of casserole dishes can be
obtained by varying the sauce.

SUGGESTIONS: (These proportions are for 1 cup white sauce.)

PARSLEY SAUCE: Add 2 to 4 tablespoons chopped parsley after sauce has
cooled.

HORSERADISH SAUCE: Add ¼ cup grated horseradish, drained, and ¼ teaspoon
dry mustard.

CHEESE SAUCE: Add ½ cup grated cheese and a dash of paprika. Stir over
low heat until cheese is melted, or substitute 1½ teaspoons
Worcestershire Sauce for paprika.

OLIVE SAUCE: Add 1 egg, unbeaten, ¼ cup light cream and cook over hot
water 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add ⅓ cup chopped ripe or stuffed
olives.

_Other Uses_

GARNISHES:

Many gay garnishes are easily made from raw vegetables. Place garnishes,
such as radish roses, celery curls or carrot sticks in a bowl of ice
water for crisping. Later these vegetables can be wrapped in a damp
cloth and stored in the refrigerator crisper until ready to serve.

SANDWICHES AND HORS D’OEUVRES:

[Illustration: uncaptioned]

Sandwiches and hors d’oeuvres can be successfully stored for several
hours in the household refrigerator. It is especially important that the
bread for hors d’oeuvres or sandwiches be spread generously with butter.
This is to prevent the filling from soaking into the bread. Wrap
sandwiches in waxed paper and then in a damp cloth. If they are arranged
on trays, cover with waxed paper and a damp cloth. Sandwich fillings,
too, can be stored in the refrigerator until serving time.
