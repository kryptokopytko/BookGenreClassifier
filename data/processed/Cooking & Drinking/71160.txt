Homemade
Candy—Sweet
and Dandy]

_Whether you take candymaking seriously or like to make it only for
special occasions, you will find the recipes for the most popular
homemade candy in this folder. They were developed in the Best Foods
Karo Kitchens, where candymaking is taken seriously. Karo syrup in
the candy mixture helps to give a smooth, creamy texture as in fudge,
a soft chewy texture as in taffy or a crisp non-sticky texture as in
peanut brittle or candy apples._

Crazy Crunch

1⅓ cups sugar
1 cup Nucoa or Mazola margarine
½ cup Karo light or dark corn syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla
8 cups popped corn
⅔ cup toasted pecans
1⅓ cups toasted almonds

Combine sugar, margarine and corn syrup in 2 quart saucepan. Bring
to boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Continue boiling,
stirring occasionally, 10 to 15 minutes or until mixture turns a
light caramel color (290°F.). Remove from heat; stir in vanilla. Pour
syrup over popped corn and nuts on baking sheet. Toss with two large
spoons until popped corn and nuts are coated. Spread out to dry.
Break into pieces and store in tightly covered container or plastic
bag. Makes about 1¾ pounds.

Combine sugar, light corn syrup and water in a 2-quart saucepan.
Stirring constantly, cook over medium heat until sugar is dissolved
and mixture comes to a boil. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally,
until temperature reaches 235°F. or until a small amount of mixture
dropped into very cold water forms a soft ball. Remove from heat. Add
rum extract, salt and walnuts. Stir until mixture begins to thicken
and turn white. Pour onto well greased baking sheet. Using 2 forks
separate into clusters. Cool and store in an airtight container.

Combine sugar, evaporated milk and corn syrup in 2-quart saucepan.
Stirring constantly, cook over medium heat until mixture comes to
a boil. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until temperature
reaches 238°F. or until a small amount of mixture dropped into very
cold water forms a soft ball. Remove from heat. Add margarine; do not
stir. Cool to lukewarm (110°F.). Add vanilla and beat until creamy.
Stir in pecans. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto waxed paper. Shape with
a spoon into a 2½-inch circle, spreading pecans. Allow to remain

Old Fashioned Popcorn Balls

1 cup Karo light or dark corn syrup
1 cup firmly packed brown sugar
¼ cup water
1 teaspoon vinegar
2 tablespoons Mazola or Nucoa margarine
2 quarts unsalted popped corn

Combine corn syrup, brown sugar, water and vinegar in saucepan.
Stirring constantly, cook over medium heat until mixture comes to
a boil. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until temperature
reaches 260°F., or until small amount of mixture dropped into very
cold water forms a ball which is hard enough to hold its shape, yet
plastic. Remove from heat. Quickly add margarine; blend. Slowly pour
over popped corn in large bowl, mixing well. Shape into balls, using
as little pressure as possible. (Grease hands, if desired.) Makes 15
(2½-inch) balls.

Pink Cinnamon Popcorn Balls: Follow recipe for Old Fashioned Popcorn
Balls, using light corn syrup and substituting granulated sugar for
brown sugar. Add ¼ cup red cinnamon candies to syrup when mixture
boils.

Pastel Popcorn Balls: Follow recipe for Pink Cinnamon Popcorn Balls,
omitting red cinnamon candies. When adding margarine, add 2 teaspoons
vanilla and enough food coloring for desired shade.

Fondant

⅓ cup Nucoa or Mazola margarine
½ cup Karo light corn syrup
1 pound confectioners sugar, sifted
1 teaspoon vanilla

Mix together margarine, corn syrup and 2 cups sugar in 3-quart
saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture
comes to full boil. Stir in remaining sugar and vanilla. Remove from
heat; stir until mixture holds shape. Pour into greased baking pan.
Cool just enough to handle. Knead with lightly greased hands until
smooth. (If candy hardens too much before kneading, work with spoon,
then knead.) Knead in any desired flavoring and coloring. Shape into
small patties, balls or use as filling for nuts, dates or apricots.
Makes about 1⅓ pounds.

Divinity

2½ cups sugar
½ cup Karo light corn syrup
½ cup water
¼ teaspoon salt
2 egg whites
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup coarsely chopped walnuts or pecans (optional)

Mix together sugar, corn syrup, water and salt in 2-quart saucepan.
Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to
boil. Reduce heat; cook without stirring until temperature reaches
248°F., or until a small amount of mixture dropped into very cold
water forms a firm ball which does not flatten on removal from
water. Just before temperature reaches 248°F., beat egg whites in
large bowl until stiff but not dry. Beating constantly, on high
speed of electric mixer, slowly pour about ½ the hot syrup over
egg whites. Then cook remaining syrup to 272°F., or until a small
amount separates into threads which are hard but not brittle when
dropped into very cold water. Beating constantly, pour hot syrup over
first mixture about 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well after each
addition. Continue beating until mixture begins to lose its gloss and
a small amount of mixture holds soft peak when dropped from spoon.
(If mixture becomes too stiff for mixer, beat with wooden spoon.) Mix
in vanilla and nuts. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto waxed paper. Makes 1¼
pounds or 48 pieces.

Candy Apples

8 medium red apples
8 flat wooden skewers or spoons
2 cups sugar
1 cup Karo light corn syrup
½ cup water
¼ cup (1¾-ounce bottle) red cinnamon candies
10 drops red food coloring (optional)

Wash and dry apples; remove stems and insert skewers into stem ends.
Combine sugar, light corn syrup and water in heavy 2-quart saucepan.
Stirring constantly, cook over medium heat until mixture boils and
sugar is dissolved. Then cook, without stirring, until temperature
reaches 250°F. or until small amount of syrup dropped into very cold
water forms a ball which is hard enough to hold its shape, yet plastic.
Add cinnamon candies and continue cooking to 285°F. or until small
amount of syrup dropped into very cold water separates into threads
which are hard, but not brittle. Remove from heat. Stir in red food
coloring, if desired. Hold each apple by its skewer and quickly twirl
in syrup, tilting pan to cover apple with syrup. Remove apple from
syrup; allow excess to drip off, then twirl to spread syrup smoothly
over apple. Place on lightly greased baking sheet to cool. Store in
cool place. Makes 8 candy apples.
