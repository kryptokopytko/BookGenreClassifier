Lea & Perrins' Sauce is manufactured from the choicest ingredients
collected from various countries and scientifically blended under the
most sanitary conditions.

It has earned its world-wide reputation by always maintaining the
highest standard of quality through several generations.

Messrs. Lea & Perrins alone hold the recipe for manufacturing the
original Worcestershire Sauce, and the flavor and quality of their
sauce is the recognized standard throughout the world.

It is known in South Africa, in India, in far China and Japan, in South
America, in Canada, as well as America.

It stands on the tables of every-equipped dinning car, steamship
line, luxurious hotel and in millions of homes: the housekeeper also
uses it in cooking to give zest and unequalled flavor to the simple but
delicious dishes which she prepares at home.

Every bottle of the original Worcestershire Sauce bears their
signature, thus:

[Illustration: _Lea & Perrins_]

If Lea & Perrins' signature does not appear on the wrapper and label,
it is not the original Worcestershire.

When ordering sauce, order by the name "Lea & Perrins" and thus get the
original Worcestershire.

CHAPTER I

THE NEW DINNER APPETIZER

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

"But, isn't there something new to serve at the beginning of a dinner
in place of fruit, or soup, or oysters, or the now prohibited cocktail?"

Yes--there is--something new and delicious and different. It is the new
"dinner appetizer"--the piquancy and "punch" of which come from the
delicious appetizer dressing--seasoned with =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.

This Appetizer Dressing is made by combining in the proper proportions,
the finest table catsup with the finest table sauce--=Lea & Perrins'
Sauce=--the original Worcestershire. It is the zest--the inimitable
flavor and the unequalled seasoning power--of =Lea & Perrins'
Sauce= which makes these new first courses for dinner worthy of the
"Dinner Appetizer" name.

These new Dinner Appetizers are not only inexpensive and easy to
prepare at home, but they seem to surround the home table with the
attractive and costly atmosphere of the most luxurious hotel.

A wine, cocktail, sundae or other glass is placed in the center of a
small plate. The appetizer--tomato, devilled egg, mushroom, shrimp,
beet or olive--is arranged on lettuce leaves on the plate around
the glass, and the glass is filled with the appetizer dressing.
These are placed with an oyster or other fork on a service plate at
each individual cover just before dinner is announced and create an
attractive and appetizing impression as each guest enters the dining
room. Each appetizer and lettuce leaf is dipped in the Appetizer
Dressing just before it is eaten.

To vary the arrangement of these dinner appetizers the Appetizer
Dressing may be served in a tomato shell, or a green pepper case from
which all seeds and pulp have been removed, or in a little cup cut from
bread, and fried in deep fat for forty seconds to brown and harden the
surface.

APPETIZER DRESSING

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

2 teaspoonfuls of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
4 tablespoonfuls of tomato catsup.

For every individual service desired, use the above proportions of
=Lea & Perrins' Sauce= and tomato catsup. Add the =Lea &
Perrins'= to the catsup, blend well, and put in the ice-box to
chill.

Place this dressing in a chilled cocktail, sundae or other glass in
the center of a small plate and serve surrounding with crisp lettuce
leaves on which tomato, devilled egg, shrimp, sardine or other
attractive dinner appetizers have been arranged. The lettuce and
appetizers are dipped in the dressing with an oyster fork and eaten.

TOMATO APPETIZER

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

One tomato may be used for two services. Put the tomatoes in
a wire strainer and quickly dip in and out of boiling water.
Place immediately in cold water and peel. Place on ice to chill
thoroughly. When ready to serve, quarter each tomato and recut each
quarter into two or three parts, depending on the size. Arrange
these on crisp lettuce leaves around a cocktail, sundae or other
glass containing the Appetizer Dressing. Serve with an oyster fork.
Dip each tomato and leaf in the Appetizer Dressing just before
eating.

DEVILLED EGG APPETIZER

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Use one hard-cooked egg for each individual service. Cut the egg in
half and remove the yolk to a bowl. Add 1 tablespoonful of grated
cheese, ¼ teaspoonful of salt and a drop of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=
to each yolk of egg. Cream all together and refill egg white. Cut
each egg half into four quarter pieces and place on lettuce leaves.
Arrange the Appetizer Dressing in a glass in center of plate. Serve
with oyster fork.

BEET BALL APPETIZER

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Cut small balls from a cooked beet with a fancy potato ball
cutter, or cut a small beet into quarters and recut each quarter
into suitable sizes. Place the cut beets in a bowl and cover with
vinegar. Chill. When ready to serve drain off vinegar and roll each
piece of beet in finely grated cheese. Arrange on lettuce with the
Appetizer Dressing in a glass in the center of the plate and serve
with an oyster fork.

SARDINE APPETIZER

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Cut large canned sardines into pieces easily handled with an oyster
fork and arrange on lettuce with the Appetizer Dressing in a glass
in the center of the plate.

SHRIMP APPETIZER

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Arrange small canned shrimps on lettuce leaves, place the Appetizer
Dressing in a glass at one side or the center of the plate and serve
with an oyster fork. Dip each shrimp and leaf in the Appetizer
Dressing just before it is eaten.

MUSHROOM APPETIZER

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Remove the stems from fresh mushrooms, peel the caps and cook in
slowly boiling, salted water for ten or fifteen minutes. If canned
mushrooms are used, drain, remove stems and cook slowly in freshly
boiling, salted water for five minutes. Drain the mushrooms, cool
and place in ice box to chill. When ready to serve, arrange the
mushrooms on crisp lettuce leaves and place the Appetizer Dressing
in a glass in the center of the plate. Serve with an oyster fork.
Each mushroom and lettuce leaf are dipped in the dressing just
before eating.

LEA & PERRINS' CLAM COCKTAIL

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

25 clams with own juice.
4 cupfuls of water.
3 large stalks of celery.

Add the water and celery to the clams and juice and boil seven
minutes. Strain through fine cloth and cool. Serve in cups, adding
to each cup 1 teaspoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.

NOTE.--Canned or bottled clam bouillon may be used in this recipe in
place of the clams. In this case, use only 2 cupfuls of water
and 2 cupfuls of the canned clam bouillon.

OYSTER OR CLAM APPETIZER

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

When oysters or clams are to be served on the half shell, place the
Appetizer Dressing in a small glass in the center of each plate.

CHAPTER II

HOW TO IMPROVE DRESSINGS AND GRAVIES WITH LEA & PERRINS' SAUCE

After all, there are only a certain number of meats and fishes--and a
tiresomely small number, too, we often think. But the thing that makes
them seem more varied--the different feature of each is the dressing
or gravy that is served with them--the dressing which is made through
the inimitable flavor of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=, a distinguishing
addition to the dish.

The zest, the piquancy, the keen edge which =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=
gives to a dressing or gravy has long been known and used to advantage
by the high-salaried chefs of our luxurious restaurants and hotels.
And now that the chef's secret is known, every homemaker has at her
fingers' ends the basic knowledge for creating from one or two recipes
an infinite variety of rich, delicious dressings that will transform
the plainest food and make the simplest home meal an appetizing repast.

Foods that are too dry can be bettered with a thin dressing--enhanced
by the addition of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=; for more moist foods
a thicker gravy, also seasoned with Lea & Perrins' Sauce, should be
added. Plain dishes may be embellished, rich dishes "toned down" with
contrasting flavors.

But whether the dressing be thick or thin, mild or rich, the addition
of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= improves beyond your expectation the
recipe wherein it is used. Its flavor cannot be imitated, and it has
never been equalled. It is the original Worcestershire--and the only
all-perfect seasoning.

=Lea & Perrins= are the sole manufacturers of the Original
Worcestershire Sauce. Be sure to add =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= to all
recipes.

DIFFERENT KINDS OF DRESSINGS

There are two big classes of dressings, brown and white. The brown
dressings are usually made with meat juices or extracts known as
"stock," or by first browning the flour which is used to thicken them.
The white or cream dressings are made with white stock, the water in
which vegetables, onion, celery, rice, chicken or mutton have been
cooked, milk or cream as the liquid ingredient, and thickened with
white flour. The brown dressings are more frequently served with meats,
poultry and game, the white or cream dressings with fish and vegetables.

Dressings are also named by the main ingredient from which they gain
their flavor, as Mushroom Dressing, Tomato Dressing, Mint Dressing,
Cheese Dressing.

Other dressings are classified by the ingredient with which they are
thickened, as Flour and Butter Dressings, Cornstarch Dressings, Egg
Dressings and Drawn Butter Dressings.

HOW AND WHEN TO SEASON DRESSINGS WITH LEA & PERRINS' SAUCE

To procure the full zest, piquancy and flavor of =Lea & Perrins'
Sauce= in seasoning any dressing or gravy, you must add the Lea &
Perrins' Sauce just before removing the dressing from the fire. If
the dressing must stand for any length of time, do not add =Lea &
Perrins' Sauce= until just before serving time.

The proportion of LEA & PERRINS' SAUCE to add to meat
dressings and gravies is, for an average taste, about two teaspoonfuls
of =Lea & Perrins'= to every cupful of dressing. To delicate
white stock dressings and vegetable sauces, in which the flavor of the
vegetable should dominate, use one-half of a teaspoonful of =Lea &
Perrins' Sauce= to every cupful of dressing.

When such vegetables as onion, bay leaf, carrots or other highly
seasoned vegetables are used in a sauce, they should be cooked in
the butter or fat with which the sauce is made before the liquid is
added. But if the vegetable which is used in the dressing is to be
retained in the sauce, it is frequently added after the dressing has
been completed. This is the case when chopped olives, asparagus tips,
mushrooms and other vegetables are used.

BROWN DRESSINGS

BASIC BROWN DRESSING

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

2 teaspoonfuls of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
2 tablespoonfuls of butter.
3 tablespoonfuls of flour.
½ teaspoonful of salt.
1 cupful of brown meat stock or other liquid.[1]

Melt the butter, remove from fire and stir in flour until smooth;
reheat and again remove from fire. Slowly stir in the liquid, which
may be meat juice, stock, or bouillon broth. Return to fire and
allow sauce to boil for two or three minutes. Add the =Lea & Perrins'
Sauce=, and serve at once. This sauce is good with roasted meats,
croquettes or stews.

[Footnote 1: STOCK.--When brown meat stock or white vegetable stock
is mentioned in a recipe, it means the water in which the meat or
vegetable was cooked. In case of roasting or broiling, the juices,
which cook out of the meat are used.]

MUSHROOM DRESSING

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Add ½ cupful of finely chopped, canned or fresh cooked mushrooms
to the Basic Brown Dressing. Cook for five minutes and serve with
croquettes, meat cakes, steak or chicken.

OLIVE DRESSING

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Sauté ½ cupful of chopped olives in a little butter and add to the
Basic Brown Dressing just before serving. Serve with steak, roast
fowl or baked fish.

TOMATO DRESSING

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Add an extra teaspoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= to the above
recipe and in place of the meat stock use the same amount of tomato
juice. Serve with meat or fish croquettes, macaroni or rice.

CREOLE DRESSING

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

To make this sauce, add 5 finely cut olives and ½ of a chopped
green pepper to the Tomato Dressing recipe and cook until well
blended. Serve with meats, fish or fish croquettes.

PICKLE DRESSING

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Chop 2 small pickles into fine pieces and add to the Basic Brown
Dressing recipe together with 1 tablespoonful each of capers and
chives. Just before serving add an extra teaspoonful of Lea &
Perrins' Sauce if a very hot sauce is desired. Serve with steak,
fried liver or game.

JELLY DRESSING

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Melt ¼ of a glassful of currant jelly over hot water, add 1
tablespoonful of lemon juice and add 1 cupful of Basic Brown
Dressing. Serve with roast turkey, chicken, goose or any preferred
game.

SPANISH DRESSING

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

To the butter with which the Basic Brown Dressing is made add 1
sliced carrot, 2 tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley and ½ of a
chopped onion. Cook well and finish cooking as usual. Serve with
meats, meat croquettes, fish or omelettes.

ONION DRESSING

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

To the butter or fat with which the Basic Brown Dressing is made,
add ½ chopped onion. Cook until the onion is brown, add the rest of
the ingredients and the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=. Serve with meats,
particularly steak, croquettes or chopped meats.

WHITE DRESSINGS

BASIC WHITE DRESSING

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

1 teaspoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
2 tablespoonfuls of butter.
2 tablespoonfuls of flour.
¼ teaspoonful of salt.
1 cupful of white vegetable stock.

Melt the butter, add the flour and stir until smooth. Add the salt.
Remove from the fire and stir in the white vegetable stock (water
in which vegetables, celery, onion, rice, cereal or macaroni were
cooked) until smooth. Return to fire, let boil one minute and add
the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= just after removing from the fire to
serve. Serve with vegetables--canned or fresh--rice or macaroni, or
vegetable croquettes.

CAULIFLOWER DRESSING

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

To the Basic White Dressing add 1 cupful of cooked cauliflower buds,
1 teaspoonful of lemon juice and just before serving 1 tablespoonful
of butter. Serve with reheated chicken, turkey or fish.

CELERY DRESSING

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Use 1 cupful of the water in which celery has been cooked as the
stock in making the Basic White Dressing. Add to it 1 cupful of
chopped celery and serve with boiled fish or reheated chicken or
turkey.

CHEESE DRESSING

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

To 1 cupful of the Basic White Dressing, made with the water in
which rice was cooked, add ½ of a cupful of grated cheese and 2
extra teaspoonfuls of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= just after removing
from the fire. Serve with macaroni, spaghetti, rice, hominy,
cauliflower, asparagus or potatoes.

OYSTER DRESSING

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Heat 12 oysters until their edges begin to curl. Drain off the
liquor and use it in making the Basic White Dressing. If there is
not enough oyster liquor to make one cupful, add white vegetable
or cereal stock to it. Make the White Dressing as usual and when
ready to serve add the oysters finely chopped. Serve with baked or
boiled fish, or fish croquettes or roasted fowl. This also makes a
delicious sauce to pour over stewed celery or panned mushrooms.

DRAWN BUTTER DRESSINGS

PLAIN BUTTER DRESSING

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

1 teaspoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
6 tablespoonfuls of butter.
2 tablespoonfuls of flour.
½ teaspoonful of salt.
1 cupful of boiling water.

Melt 3 tablespoonfuls of the butter. Stir in the flour until smooth.
Add the salt. Remove from fire and add the boiling water slowly,
stirring smooth. Return to fire and boil for three minutes. Remove
from fire but keep pan on warm part of stove and beat in the rest of
the butter, adding it a teaspoonful at a time. This last part must
be done very carefully or a good butter sauce cannot be obtained.
Add the _Lea & Perrins' Sauce_. Serve with fish, cauliflower,
asparagus or other fresh vegetables.

LEMON DRESSING

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Add 3 tablespoonfuls of lemon juice to the Plain Butter Dressing and
beat into it with the last of the butter the yolks of 2 eggs. Serve
with shad, shad roe or other fish.

EGG DRESSING

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Add 2 hard-cooked eggs, cut into tiny pieces with a silver knife,
to the Plain Butter Dressing. Serve with macaroni, rice or fish
croquettes.

MISCELLANEOUS DRESSINGS

MAÎTRE DE HOTEL DRESSING

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Cream 4 tablespoonfuls of butter; add ½ a teaspoonful of salt, 2
teaspoonfuls of finely chopped parsley, 2 teaspoonfuls of lemon
juice, creaming them into the butter very slowly. Last add 4 or
5 drops of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= and cream in well. Serve with
broiled meats or fish.

BEARNAISE DRESSING

=Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce=

2 tablespoonfuls of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
2 tablespoonfuls of chopped onion.
1 teaspoonful of vinegar.
2 egg yolks.
6 tablespoonfuls of butter.
1 tablespoonful of chopped parsley.

Cook the chopped onion in one teaspoonful of butter and add the
vinegar. Add another small piece of the butter, the well-beaten
yolks of the eggs and cook over hot water. Add the rest of the
butter slowly, a little at a time, beating the sauce constantly
until all has been added. Lastly add the chopped parsley and the
=Lea & Perrins' Sauce=. The sauce should be almost as thick as
mayonnaise dressing. It may be served either hot or cold, with
steak, fillet mignon or fish.

HOLLANDAISE DRESSING

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

1 teaspoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
6 tablespoonfuls of butter.
2 egg yolks.
¼ teaspoonful of salt.
½ cupful of boiling water.
Juice of ½ lemon.

Cream the butter, add the egg yolks, well beaten, one at a time,
and cream them thoroughly into the butter. Add the salt and boiling
water and cook over hot water, stirring constantly until the sauce
thickens; add the lemon juice last and remove from the fire. Add the
=Lea & Perrins' Sauce=. Do not cook the sauce too rapidly as there
is danger of it separating. If it does, remove at once to a pan of
cold water and beat vigorously. Serve with asparagus, cauliflower,
baked or boiled fish.

MINT DRESSING

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Carefully pick a bunch of mint leaves from the stems and chop very
fine. Pour ¼ cupful of boiling water over them, add 2 tablespoonfuls
of sugar, cover and stand half an hour in a cool place. Add 3
tablespoonfuls of vinegar and ½ teaspoonful of =Lea & Perrins'
Sauce=.

CHAPTER III

CHOWDERS AND SOUPS

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

In soups and chowders, where herbs and spices are such an important
element, =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=, an unusual blending of many
spices and flavors, forms the finest possible addition. It will blend
with whatever herb, spice or vegetable the recipe requires, and in
cases where certain spices are hard to obtain it will, with its own
inimitable piquancy, give the dish a perfect, complete and unequalled
flavor.

In earlier days the fishermen each brought their own share of fish to
the big family caldron, and when the dish, which contained biscuits,
onions and a "hodge-podge" of other vegetables, was finished, the
members of the family received an equal share. So a real genuine
chowder should be composed of fish, although we have to-day many
combinations of vegetable chowders.

FISH CHOWDER

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

1 tablespoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
3 pounds of fish.
¼ pound of salt pork.
10 large potatoes.
1 onion.
12 soda crackers.
Salt.
3 cupfuls of white stock or rice water.
3 tablespoonfuls of flour.
4 tablespoonfuls of butter.

Any fresh, white fish may be used. Skin the fish, remove the fleshy
part and cover the bones, head and skin with water. Let simmer for
half an hour. Add the onion with the salt pork, both cut in small
pieces. Strain this liquid through a fine strainer and pour over the
white flaky part of the fish.

Add the potatoes cut in small pieces, salt, and simmer until the
potatoes are tender. Then add the white stock or rice water and the
soda crackers cut in half and spread with part of the butter.

Melt the rest of butter. Stir in the flour and add part of the

GARNISHINGS FOR SOUP

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

The attractive garnishings which are served in soups in the big
hotels are very easy to prepare at home and add a touch of luxury
that more than pays for the trouble put into their making.

EGG YOLKS IN SOUP GARNISHING

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

1 tablespoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
6 egg yolks.
1 teaspoonful of salt.

CHAPTER IV

CROQUETTES, TIMBALES, CASSEROLES, STEWS AND OTHER MEAT DISHES

=Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce=

One of the greatest problems in the average household is what to do
with meat, fish or vegetables which are of too small a quantity to
serve alone and yet too worth-while to be wasted. Deliciously seasoned
with =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=, croquettes, cutlets, meat cakes or
creamed dishes, served in attractive bread and pastry cases, not only
help to keep down the meat bill, but also to keep up the family's
enthusiasm for mother's cooking. By forming the well-known cone-shaped
croquette into a cylinder-shaped or a crescent-shaped cutlet, and
serving it with any one of the delicious Spanish, Creole, Tomato or
Mushroom Dressings given in Chapter II, an old recipe is made into a
new dinner surprise.

BASIC RECIPE FOR CROQUETTES

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

2 tablespoonfuls of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
4 tablespoonfuls of butter.
8 tablespoonfuls of flour.
1⅓ cupfuls of stock or rice water.
½ teaspoonful of salt.
2 cupfuls of cooked meat.
1 egg.
Bread crumbs.

Melt the butter, add the salt, remove from fire and stir in the
flour until smooth. Add the stock or rice water slowly, stirring
constantly, until all is added and boil for five minutes, or until
thick and creamy. Add the cooked meat, ground, the =Lea & Perrins'
Sauce=, and cool.

When thoroughly chilled, pat mixture into desired cylinder or cutlet
shape and roll in bread crumbs. Beat the egg until well blended,
adding to it 1 tablespoonful of melted butter and 3 tablespoonfuls
of water. Dip the croquette in this egg mixture, roll in the bread
crumbs again, and put into the ice-box for an hour or more to harden
before frying.

Fry in deep fat or oil which will brown a cube of bread to a golden
brown in 40 seconds. Do not fry croquettes for more than 40 seconds.
Drain in frying basket or on brown paper.

If desired, pour 2 tablespoonfuls of oil or melted fat over the
unfried croquettes and bake in a very hot oven for from five to
eight minutes, dressing occasionally with more oil if necessary.

Serve with Tomato, Cheese, Mushroom or Hollandaise sauce given in
Chapter II.

If croquettes have been shaped into cutlets, a macaroni stick is
usually stuck in the pointed end to imitate a chop bone.

VEAL CROQUETTES

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

A delicious combination calls for 1 cupful of cooked and cubed veal
and ½ cupful of rice in place of the meat required in the above
recipe. Proceed as usual, shaping the croquette into cutlet or chop
shape. Serve with a Tomato, Spanish, Creole or a Mushroom dressing.

CHICKEN CUTLETS

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

For this use 1½ cupfuls of cooked cubed chicken, or 1 cupful of
chicken and ½ cupful of cooked sweetbreads, celery or mushrooms as
desired, in the Basic Croquette recipe. Serve with White, Celery or
Oyster dressing given on page 10.

RICE CROQUETTES

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

2 tablespoonfuls of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
4 cupfuls of cooked rice.
¼ cupful of grated cheese.
2 eggs.
Bread crumbs.

Add the grated cheese to the rice and bind the mixture together
with 1 well-beaten egg to which 2 tablespoonfuls of water has been
added. Add the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=. If too stiff, add a little
more water, form into croquettes, roll in bread crumbs, beaten egg
and bread crumbs again and chill. Fry in fat hot enough to brown a
cube of bread in 40 seconds. Drain and serve with Spanish or Creole
dressing. These croquettes may form the basis of a luncheon menu or
may be served as a vegetable or side dish for dinner.

MACARONI CROQUETTES

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Cut cooked macaroni into fine pieces, and measure four cupfuls.
Add ½ cupful of grated cheese, bind the mixture together with 1
well-beaten egg, add 2 tablespoonfuls of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=, a
little more water if the mixture is too stiff to mold, shape into
croquettes, chill and fry as usual.

PEANUT OR WALNUT CROQUETTES

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Use 4 cupfuls of ground peanuts or walnuts in place of meat in the
Basic Croquette recipe. Add enough of the croquette sauce to the
nuts to make them easy to mold. Shape into croquettes, roll in bread
crumbs, egg and crumbs again and chill. Fry as usual.

SWEET POTATO CROQUETTES

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

These are made the same way as the rice croquettes, using sweet
potatoes in place of the rice in the Rice Croquettes recipe and
omitting the cheese.

MUSHROOM CROQUETTES

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

For these use 2 cupfuls of chopped mushrooms in making the Basic
Croquette recipe. Add to them just enough of the croquette sauce to
mold firmly together. Shape and fry as usual. Serve with a Cream,
Hollandaise or Bearnaise Sauce.

SALMON CUTLETS

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Use 2 cupfuls of canned salmon and 2 cupfuls of cooked rice, adding
2½ tablespoonfuls of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=, ½ teaspoonful of salt
and 1 tablespoonful of lemon juice. Bind together with an egg and
shape into croquettes, rolling in bread crumbs and beaten egg as
usual. Fry and serve with Tomato, Bearnaise or Hollandaise Sauce.

FISH CUTLETS

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Proceed as in making Salmon Cutlets, using the same proportions of
any preferred cooked fish.

SURPRISE CROQUETTES

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Press into the center of fish or meat croquettes, just before
rolling in the bread crumbs, a raw oyster, a cooked mushroom, a
stuffed olive or a piece of hard-cooked devilled egg. When the
croquette is eaten the diner is delighted to find in the center this
spicy surprise.

REMEMBER:--_Lea & Perrins' is the Only Original Worcestershire
Sauce. None of the so-called "Worcestershires" can be used in these
recipes with good results._

TIMBALES

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Timbales are in reality very fine croquette mixtures, pressed into
individual molds and poached in hot water or baked in the oven. In
making timbales the meat, fish or vegetable is pounded or mashed until
it is very fine and added to a very thick white sauce. This is poured
into an oiled mold which is lined with buttered bread crumbs, macaroni,
spaghetti, olives, peas or fancy cut pimentos.

BASIC SAUCE FOR TIMBALES

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

1 teaspoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
2 tablespoonfuls of butter.
½ cupful of flour.
½ cupful of boiling water.
1 egg.
¼ teaspoonful of salt.

Melt the butter and stir in half of the flour. Add half of the
boiling water, stir until smooth. Add the rest of the flour slowly,
stirring constantly, so that no lumps will be formed, and the rest
of the boiling water, and the salt. Cook, stirring constantly to
prevent scorching, until the whole sauce will leave the pan in one
thick mass. Remove from fire and beat the egg, which has been well
beaten, into the mixture. Add =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=. Allow to
cool, add desired ingredient and pour into buttered or oiled timbale
molds and poach in hot water.

CHICKEN TIMBALES

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Add 1 cupful of chicken meat which has been ground through a meat
chopper and forced through a purée strainer to the Basic Timbale
Sauce. Add also 3 finely chopped mushrooms. Fill oiled timbale
molds, lined with one long piece of spaghetti, with the chicken
timbale mixture and poach in boiling water or bake in a hot oven for
ten minutes. Serve with Mushroom or Celery Sauce and garnish with
parsley.

FISH TIMBALES

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Add 1 cupful of finely picked fish which has been forced through a
purée strainer to the Basic Timbale Sauce. Add an extra teaspoonful
of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= and 1 tablespoonful of lemon juice.
Blend well and force into well-oiled timbale molds. Poach or bake
for ten minutes and serve with Hollandaise Sauce.

HAM TIMBALES

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Cut cold, boiled ham into fine pieces to make one cupful and run
through finest cutter of meat chopper. Run again through meat
chopper and then force through purée strainer. Add this to the Basic
Timbale Sauce and fill into timbale mold which has been oiled and
lined with olive rings. Poach in hot water for ten minutes or bake
in the oven for that time. Serve with Bearnaise sauce and garnish
with parsley.

STEWS AND CASSEROLE DISHES

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

In stews and casserole dishes our object is to make tender by slow,
long cooking the meat selected, besides cooking with it herbs, spices
and vegetables to supplement and flavor it.

Of all the spices and herbs which it is possible to add to these
casserole dishes and stews, there is no seasoning that will produce
just that zestful, appetizing flavor which =Lea & Perrins'
Sauce=--itself a secret blend of the finest spices--gives.

Use it freely in seasoning all kinds of long-cooked meat
dishes--goulashes, pot roasts, ragouts, stews, casseroles and meat
pies. Use it also in making meat loaf and rolled meated dishes, in
croquettes and timbales. In fact, wherever you use meat in cooking,
remember to--

_Improve it with Lea & Perrins' Sauce._

BEEF STEW

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

2 tablespoonfuls of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
3 pounds of stewing beef.
1 onion.
1 carrot.
6 potatoes.
1 turnip.
6 cupfuls of water.
1 green pepper.

Select a piece of shin meat, the flank end of a roast or a cut of
the chuck ribs, as these contain fat meat, lean meat and a little
bone, all of which are necessary to a good stew.

Cut the meat from the bones, wipe the bones carefully to remove any
small cracked pieces and place in stewing kettle. Add the 6 cupfuls
of boiling water.

Melt a piece of fat, from the meat, in a shallow pan and cook the
cut onion in it until brown. Slice and brown the carrot and turnip,
and add to the kettle.

Braise the meat in these same fat drippings, turning frequently and
cooking on all sides until white, which closes the meat tubes and
keeps the juices within the meat during the long, slow cooking that
follows. Add the meat and the drippings in which it was cooked to
the stewing kettle. Remove seeds and pulp from pepper and add to the
stew.

Simmer slowly for three hours or until the meat is tender. Skim the
fat from the kettle and remove the bones. Add the potatoes, which
have been washed, peeled and cut in quarters. Cook until these are
done and the meat will be ready to serve. Add the =Lea & Perrins'
Sauce=. Arrange the carrot, turnip, onion, pepper and potato
around the meat on a platter. Thicken the stock left in the kettle
with shortening and flour. Add an extra teaspoonful of =Lea &
Perrins' Sauce=, and serve.

RAGOUT OF MUTTON OR LAMB

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

2 tablespoonfuls of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
3 pounds of mutton or lamb.
2 onions.
2 carrots.
6 potatoes.
2 cupfuls of tomato juice.
1 teaspoonful of salt.

Cube the meat into pieces two inches square and sear in drippings
from the fat of the meat. Put meat in kettle and cover with water.
Brown the onion in the drippings and add with salt and drippings to
meat. Simmer for two hours or more, skim off fat, add the tomato
juice, the potatoes peeled and cut in quarters and the carrot cubed
or cut in balls with a potato cutter. Remove meat from stew, place
on platter surrounded with the vegetables, add the =Lea & Perrins'
Sauce= to the meat stock, and pour over the meat and vegetables.
Serve at once.

LAMB KIDNEY STEW

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

1 tablespoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
6 lamb kidneys.
1 teaspoonful of salt.
2 tablespoonfuls of drippings.
2 tablespoonfuls of flour.
1 cupful of water or meat stock.

Remove all skin and fat from the kidneys and set them in water to
cover, to which a handful of salt has been added. Let stand three or
four hours, or, if possible, over-night. Remove water, put in pan
with fresh water to cover and slowly bring to boiling point but do
not boil. Drain and cut into tiny pieces. Brown the drippings and
sauté the cut kidneys in them. Add the flour and stir until smooth,
then the water or meat stock slowly, stirring constantly to make a
smooth gravy. Add the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=. Pour over toast on a
hot platter and serve.

CASSEROLE OF VEAL WITH CARROTS AND PEAS

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

1 tablespoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
2 pounds of breast of veal.
2 pieces of salt pork.
4 carrots.
1 cupful of peas.
3 potatoes.
1 onion.

Cut the veal into small pieces and sear it in a shallow pan in
drippings from one piece of the salt pork. Place the veal in a
glass casserole greased with the salt pork. Brown the onion in the
salt pork and add to the casserole. Cut the second piece of salt
pork into small squares and add to casserole. Cover meat with water
and cook in oven for an hour. Cut the potatoes and carrot into
dice-shaped pieces. Add these with the peas to the casserole about
half an hour before it is ready to take from the oven. Blanched rice
added at the same time is often a welcome addition. When both meat
and vegetables are tender, add the _Lea & Perrins' Sauce_ and serve
at once in the dish in which it was baked.

ROASTED MEAT LOAF

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

1 tablespoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
3 cupfuls of finely ground raw meat (about 2 pounds).
2 cupfuls of soft bread crumbs.
2 slices of bacon.
1 cupful of celery.
1 green pepper.
1 onion.
1 egg.

Mix the finely ground meat with the bread crumbs and celery. Add the
chopped green pepper, a little salt and pepper, the egg well beaten
and the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=. Add enough water to make mixture
moist and pack into greased brick-shaped pan. Place in ice-box to
chill and remove when cold to a greased roasting pan, turning the
loaf out of the mold. Place the bacon cut into thick strips on top
of the loaf and also slices of the onion. Pour a cupful of thin
tomato sauce over the whole and roast the meat in a hot oven for
from fifty minutes to an hour. Serve hot with Tomato Sauce, sliced
onion and crisp bacon.

Add to the boiling water and cook directly over the fire for half an
hour. Add the salt, the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=, the grated cheese
and the butter. Cook five minutes more and pour into a buttered
baking dish and serve with Creole Sauce given on page 9.

FRIED POLENTA

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Allow the polenta to cool, cut into 1-inch squares, roll in egg
and bread crumbs and fry in deep fat. Serve with Tomato, Creole or
Spanish Sauce given on pages 9 and 10.

CHAPTER V

EGGS, OMELETS, SOUFFLES, CREOLE AND RICE DISHES

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

It is almost unbelievable until you have tried it--to discover how
surprisingly delicious just a drop or two of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= can
make a soft-boiled breakfast egg taste. And when you have tried it, you
will want furthermore to fry and poach, scramble, omelet and soufflé
all of the eggs that you cook with just a little of Lea & Perrins'
Sauce added as an inimitable seasoning.

SOFT-BOILED EGG

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

There are several ways of cooking a soft-boiled egg--the best of
which is not to boil it at all.

Use one pint of _boiling_ water for each egg to be cooked. Carefully
lower the egg into the water, cover the saucepan and let stand on
back of stove for eight or ten minutes. Do not increase or diminish
heat. The white of the egg will be tender and the yolk firm all the
way through, instead of the yolk being partly uncooked and the white
very tough as is the case with a three-minute boiled egg.

Still another way is to put the egg on in cold water and remove as
soon as the water boils.

Remove egg from shell to a hot egg cup and add a large piece
of butter, a bit of salt and 2 or 3 drops of =Lea & Perrins'
Sauce=. Blend well and serve at once.

FRIED EGGS

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Eggs should never be fried, as this method of cooking, like boiling,
toughens the albumen. However, if your family must have fried eggs,
you will find the addition of a teaspoonful of =Lea & Perrins'
Sauce= to the fat in which they are cooked a decided improvement
to the eggs. Put the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= on the table and
serve with the eggs.

POACHED EGGS

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Brush a heavy iron frying pan with oil and add boiling water to the
depth of an inch or more. Add 1 tablespoonful of =Lea & Perrins'
Sauce= and a pinch of salt. Break fresh eggs into a saucer and
gently slip from saucer to water. Cook without allowing water to
boil until the egg is firm. Remove with skimmer or quickly dip piece
of toast under egg and lift out at once. Drain, then put on hot
plate and serve. If one is fortunate enough to have an egg poacher,
poaching eggs is an even simpler matter. Serve with _Lea & Perrins'
Sauce_ on the table.

BAKED EGG

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Grease an individual glass or fire-proof ramekin with oil or butter
and break an egg into it. Sprinkle with salt and season with a few
drops of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=. Bake surrounded by water in a
moderate oven for from five to ten minutes and serve with =Lea &
Perrins' Sauce= at the table.

EGG IN NEST

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Beat the white of an egg with a sprinkling of salt until light and
frothy and pile on top of a piece of toast in an individual ovenware
dish. Make a slight dent on the top of the egg white and carefully
place the yolk in the center; add a drop of =Lea & Perrins'
Sauce=. Place in a pan of water and cook in a moderate oven until
yolk and white are set. Serve with =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= at
the table.

SHIRRED EGG

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Add 1 teaspoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= to 2 tablespoonfuls
of finely chopped ham or bacon and 2 tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs.
Add enough oil or butter to blend well, and press against the
buttered sides and bottom of an individual baking dish. Break an egg
into the dish and sprinkle top with buttered bread crumbs. Bake in
a moderate oven, the dish being surrounded with hot water. Serve in
the dish in which it was baked with =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= at
the table. Mashed potato, spinach or tomato are often used to fill
sides and bottom of ramekin.

SCRAMBLED EGGS

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

In Scrambling eggs, great care should be exercised in the cooking,
the mixture being of a custard-like, creamy consistency when
finished, and not dry and lumpy as some scrambled eggs become. The
secret is in allowing the egg to cook as much in the heat of the pan
as over the fire. Keep stirring the mixture constantly removing the
pan from the fire if the eggs seem to get too dry in any one spot.

In scrambling eggs, beat the egg until light and add for each egg
used, 2 tablespoonfuls of water and a few drops of =Lea & Perrins'
Sauce=.

OMELETS AND SOUFFLES

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

An omelet may be made with or without separating the yolks and
whites of the eggs, the one being called a plain--the other a
fluffy omelet. A soufflé is a fluffy omelet made with a white sauce
foundation and baked in the oven.

Cheese, tomatoes, chopped meats and vegetables are all attractive
additions to these dishes, but, no matter what else may be added,
=Lea & Perrins' Sauce= as a seasoning for omelets and soufflés
cannot be equalled.

PLAIN OMELET

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

1 tablespoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
3 eggs.
3 tablespoonfuls of water.
¼ teaspoonful of salt.
1 tablespoonful of butter.

Beat the eggs without separating and add the water. Add the salt,
the butter melted and the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.

Heat a heavy iron frying pan and grease well with oil, bacon fat
or shortening. Pour in the egg and lower heat under pan. Tilt pan
backward and forward and from side to side, allowing liquid to run
under egg as it cooks. When cooked throughout, run spatulate or
knife under omelet and roll it into a roll. Turn out on platter and
serve with toast or any desired addition.

FLUFFY OMELET

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

1 tablespoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
4 eggs.
6 tablespoonfuls of water.
½ teaspoonful of salt.
1 tablespoonful of butter.

Separate the eggs; add the water, salt and melted butter to the
yolks. Also add the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=. Beat the whites
until light and frothy and carefully fold them into the yolks.

Grease a heavy iron pan with bacon fat and pour in the omelet. Lower
heat under pan and let cook slowly until brown on the bottom and
almost dry. Place lid over pan and let dry on top, or place in oven
for two minutes.

Cut the omelet lightly on the top and fold over without breaking
under part. Turn out on platter and serve at once.

TOMATO OMELET

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Spread sliced and fried tomatoes in between the omelet before
folding and pour the tomato gravy, which cooked out of the tomatoes
in frying, over the finished dish.

SPANISH OMELET

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Just before folding omelet over, spread with the following mixture
and pour what is left, over the whole omelet after it is placed
on the platter: 2 finely chopped onions, 1 chopped green pepper,
a few cut olives, and, if possible, a few mushrooms. Sauté these
ingredients in 2 teaspoonfuls of oil, add 1 cupful of tomato juice
and spread in between and pour over omelet.

CORN OMELET

Spread the omelet with cooked corn before folding.

VEGETABLE OMELET

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Spread the omelet with any desired combination of, or individually
cooked vegetable, as peas, carrots, asparagus, cauliflower, onions.
This also helps to use up any vegetables of which too small a
quantity has been left to permit using them alone. The vegetable
used should be heated in a little butter or cooking oil to which a
few drops of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= have been added.

CHEESE OMELET

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Sprinkle grated cheese over the omelet before and after folding. Or
add ½ cupful of grated cheese to the omelet in the making.

BACON OMELET

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Fry four or five slices of bacon until crisp. Use the bacon
drippings in place of the butter in making and frying the omelet.

folding. Garnish the plate with bacon. Serve at once.

HAM OMELET

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Chop previously fried ham very fine and reheat in some fat to which
=Lea & Perrins' Sauce= has been added. Spread on omelet.

PLAIN SOUFFLÉ

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

1 tablespoonful of Lea & Perrins' Sauce.
2 tablespoonfuls of shortening.
2 tablespoonfuls of flour.
½ cupful of milk or water.
3 eggs.

Melt the shortening, stir in the flour until smooth, remove from the
fire and slowly stir in the liquid. Add the salt and cook for three
or four minutes or until a thick, smooth sauce is made. Beat the
yolks of the eggs until creamy and add to the sauce. Remove from the
fire and add the stiffly-beaten whites of the eggs. Add the =Lea &
Perrins' Sauce=. Pour into a buttered baking dish, place dish in a
pan of hot water and bake in a slow oven for twenty or twenty-five
minutes. Serve at once.

The dish in which a soufflé is baked should be broad and wide,
rather than high and narrow, to prevent the soufflé from rising
too high in the center and then falling. It is a big help to pin a
buttered paper band around a soufflé dish before baking, so that it
will rise easily without overflowing.

CHEESE SOUFFLÉ

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

For this, use tomato juice in place of the milk or water in the

CHAPTER VI

CHAFING DISH SUPPERS

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

CHAFING DISH SUPPER MENU

_To be prepared with Lea & Perrins' Sauce in the cooking_

Welsh or Tomato Rarebit
on
Toasted Crackers
Devilled Ham, Celery and Lettuce Sandwiches
Salted Nuts Stuffed Olives
Coffee
or
Ginger Ale Orange Juice High Ball

At no other time do we so desire tasty, spicy piquant food as when we
have a chafing dish supper. And there is no other dish wherein the
supreme quality of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= shows off to better
advantage than in the chafing dish recipe. For the midnight college
spread--the Welsh, Cheese or Tomato Rarebits--for the kitchenette
apartment dinner of Creamed Dried Beef, Ham, Shrimps or Eggs, or
for the simple home Sunday night supper of Creamed Oysters, Chicken
or Chicken à la King--=Lea & Perrins' Sauce=--the original
Worcestershire--forms the unsurpassed, the perfect seasoning.

A chafing dish is composed of two flat pans, one called the blazer,
the other the hot-water pan. The usual chafing dish recipe directs the
first cooking of the material to be directly over the heat--and is
finished and the food kept hot over the hot-water pan.

The chafing dish, particularly if it is one in which alcohol is the
heating element, should always be placed on a tray, to avoid any danger
from fire or a possible "boiling over" of the food. A wooden or chafing
dish spoon is a help although not essential. The butter, flour and
things necessary for the dish to be made should be measured and placed
on the tray besides the chafing dish so that the recipe may be made
up without hurry or getting up and down from the table. With electric
grills the toast may be made under the grill while the other things are
cooking above.

WELSH RAREBIT

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

1 teaspoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
1 tablespoonful of butter.
2 cupfuls of grated American cheese.
½ cupful of cream.

Buttered soda crackers or toast.

Melt the butter in the blazer over the hot-water pan, in which
the water should be boiling. Add the grated cheese and the cream
alternately, a little at a time, allowing the cheese to melt slowly.
Add the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.

Keep over the hot water while serving and serve on buttered crackers
or toast. Serve =Lea & Perrins'= on the side, to be used for a
flavor to suit each taste.

CHEESE AND TOMATO RAREBIT

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

In the Welsh Rarebit recipe, substitute tomato purée for the cream,
add a well-beaten egg and cook until smooth and creamy. Serve with
toast or crackers as desired.

To the Welsh Rarebit add one chopped red pepper from which the seeds
and pulp have been removed.

"PIGS IN BLANKETS"

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

4 tablespoonfuls of butter.
1 cupful rice or vegetable water.

Remove all seeds and pulp from the pepper and chop it up fine.
Peel the mushrooms and break them into fine pieces. Melt the 2
tablespoonfuls of butter directly over the chafing dish flame or
grill and sauté the mushrooms and peppers in it. Add the rest of the
butter and slowly stir in the flour. Add the rice water, stirring
all until smooth. Cook until it boils for one minute, then place
in the pan over the hot water, add the chicken and cook for five
minutes. Add the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=. Serve on toast.

CREAMED SHRIMPS

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Break the shrimps from a can into small pieces and run under the
cold water. Drain. Use the same amount of butter, flour and liquid
given in the Creamed Egg recipe to make a sauce, adding the shrimps
after the sauce has been cooked for one minute. Cook over hot water
for ten minutes before serving.

CREAMED EGGS

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

1 teaspoonful of Lea & Perrins' Sauce.
6 hard-cooked eggs.
½ teaspoonful of salt.
1 tablespoonful of butter.
1 tablespoonful of flour.
1 cupful of rice water or vegetable stock.

Melt the butter directly over the chafing dish flame or grill, add
the flour, stir until smooth and slowly stir in the rice water. Cut
the hard-cooked eggs into small pieces, saving out the yolk of one.
Add the chopped egg to the white sauce and continue the cooking over
hot water. Add the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= and the salt. Serve on
points of toast and garnish with the yolk of 1 egg rubbed through a
fine strainer and sprinkle on top of the whole dish.

CREAMED SALMON

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

This is made by using salmon in the Creamed Egg recipe in place of
the eggs. Chop one hard-cooked egg into fine pieces and add to dish
before serving.

the butter and flour, which has been mixed with a little of the
oyster liquor to make a smooth paste, and when blended add the rest
of the liquid to make a white sauce. Continue cooking over hot water
for a few moments and add the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=. Serve with
toast.

CHAPTER VII

SANDWICH FILLINGS

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

Delicious and different sandwich fillings, for picnics or party
refreshments, depend for their distinction, not so much upon the meat
or cheese which is used as a filling, but upon the seasoning. =Lea &
Perrins' Sauce=, which is so delicious with meat or cheese, adds an
unequalled and spicy touch in the seasoning of sandwiches.

Bread for sandwiches should not be over a day old. In buttering
the bread, always cream the butter first in a bowl and then spread
the bread evenly with the softened butter. If saving crusts is not
necessary, it is very nice to remove these, cutting the bread into
fancy shaped slices. If a large number of sandwiches are made up for a
reception, it is best to wrap them in a wet cheese-cloth and keep them
wrapped until ready to serve.

CHAPTER VIII

CHAPTER IX

CATSUPS, CHUTNEYS, PICKLES AND HOME-MADE RELISHES

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

In pickling, we think first of Grandmother and the delicious catsups,
pickles and chutneys which she served with Sunday-night suppers and
wonder why we see these delicious relishes so seldom these days. But we
need not forego our home-made catsups, pickles and chow-chows, nor even
find them less relishing because we have no herb garden, for in _=Lea
& Perrins' Sauce=_ we have the most complete--the most ideal and
perfect relish seasoning.

=Lea & Perrins'= Original Worcestershire is in itself a secret
blending of spices which will give to any home-made relish the keen
edge--the snap--the zest it requires.

Use =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= in seasoning catsups, chow-chows,
pickles, vinegars, chutneys, piccalilli and chilli sauce relishes--it
is the unequalled spice for them all.

AN UNCOOKED TOMATO CATSUP

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

4 tablespoonfuls of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
2 quarts of red ripe tomatoes.
1 cupful of onions.
¼ cupful of salt.
1 cupful of sugar.
3 cupfuls of vinegar.

Dip the tomatoes quickly into rapidly boiling water, dip in and out
of cold water and peel. Put into large preserving kettle and add
the onions well chopped. Mash these two together and add the salt,
sugar, vinegar and last, the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=. Thoroughly
sterilize catsup bottles by boiling and fill with the cold catsup.
Cork loosely. Place bottles on a wire rack, stand in a pan which
allows rapidly boiling water to come to the neck of the bottle, and
boil or sterilize for thirty minutes. Some experts claim this final
"water bath" to be unnecessary, but the inexperienced preserver will
have better success if the last cooking is performed.

For perfect keeping and especially if the catsups are made up to
sell, the corks should be driven in tightly and the bottles sealed
with sealing wax or melted paraffin as soon as they are removed from
the water bath. Stamping the soft wax or paraffin with a special
sealing stamp also helps to give an identifying and distinguishing
mark to the product.

MUSHROOM CATSUP

cabbage, but do not chop it fine; separate cauliflower head into
small flowerettes; cut onions; also cut peppers and celery into
small strips. Soak this vegetable chow in salt and water to cover
over-night. In the morning bring them to the boiling point in the
same brine and drain. Mix the mustard and flour in a large kettle
and add enough vinegar to make a smooth paste. Add the curry powder,
brown sugar and the rest of the vinegar. Heat until the mixture is
thick and add the drained vegetable chow. Cook for five minutes. Add
=Lea & Perrins' Sauce=. Carefully pack into sterilized jars and
seal.

MUSTARD RELISH

_Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

2 tablespoonfuls of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
1 pint cucumbers.
1 pint onions.
1 cupful string beans.
3 green peppers.
3 red peppers.
1 pint tomatoes.

Dressing.

2 cupfuls vinegar.
4 tablespoonfuls flour.
1 cupful sugar.
3 tablespoonfuls mustard.
½ tablespoonful turmeric.

Cut the vegetables before measuring, halve the tomatoes, cut
cucumbers into slices, string beans in half and chop peppers after
removing seeds and pulp. Soak the vegetables in a brine of salt and
water over-night, drain and stand in clear water for two hours.
Drain and scald in one-half of the quantity of vinegar used in the
dressing and the same amount of water.

To make the dressing, mix the mustard, turmeric, flour and sugar
together. Add the vinegar slowly, stirring to make a smooth paste.
Cook over hot water, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens.
Add the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.

Drain the vegetables and pour the mustard dressing over them while
it is hot. Mix well and pack in sterilized jars. Seal, but not too
tightly, and simmer in hot water for twenty minutes. Remove, tighten
jar lids and label.

REMEMBER:--_Lea & Perrins' is the Only Original
Worcestershire sauce. None of the so-called
"Worcestershires" can be used in these recipes
with good results._
