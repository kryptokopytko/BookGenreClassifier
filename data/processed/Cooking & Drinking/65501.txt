_The Delight of the New in Cookery_

[Illustration: Dairy farm]

No matter how old a story cooking is to us, no matter how little zest we
think we have for it, we need only to have a new recipe, a new
ingredient or a new method in cookery held tantalizingly before us to
discover that our interest hasn’t waned after all. For the quest of the
new and better in cookery never loses its allure.

_Even Milk has New Secrets to Reveal_

Milk, perhaps more than anything else, seems to hold no novelty for us.
Yet we recognize in it our most important food, supplying all the
elements needed for health and growth. We know that doctors and
dietitians insist upon a quart of milk a day for each member of the
family. And we know that the simplest way to provide this milk is
through its generous use in cooking, thereby supplying it in such a
variety of form that no one tires of it.

It is therefore extremely interesting to discover that milk can
contribute to our cookery a deliciousness of flavor, a smoothness of
texture, a richness, a dependability of result and an economy of other
materials that we have never experienced if we have confined our use of
milk to ordinary bottled milk.

Only a milk of uniformly high quality and richness can produce such
cooking results. To secure this uniformly high quality and richness many
thousands of women have turned to a form of milk that adds immeasurably
to the success of cookery—Carnation Evaporated Milk.

_What Carnation Milk IS_

Carnation Milk is simply the purest of rich whole milk, from fine herds,
evaporated to double richness, “homogenized,” and sterilized for safe
keeping. To insure the quality and purity of this milk, the Carnation
Company maintains at the famous Carnation Milk Farms two of the largest
herds of pure bred Holsteins in the world—among them the world’s
greatest milk and butter producers—and introduces this high milk
producing strain into the many herds of “Contented Cows” from which the
milk for the Carnation condenseries is obtained. Carnation field men
constantly supervise these herds to insure the proper care and feeding
of the cows, and the cleanliness of the surroundings and milking
methods.

It is this better milk—rushed to the Carnation condenseries in
sterilized cans, tested and retested for purity and richness, evaporated
to double richness, “homogenized” to break up the cream globules into
minute particles and keep them uniformly distributed all through the
milk, sealed in clean, air-tight cans and sterilized—that you get in
every can of Carnation.

Nothing is added to it; nothing taken out except sixty per cent of the
water (milk is eighty-seven per cent water as it comes from the cow).
Perfect sterilization gives it a rich creamy color and insures its
staying sweet and pure indefinitely.

_What Carnation Milk DOES_

Being doubly rich because of evaporation, Carnation Milk gives to every
dish in which it is used the benefit of its double creaminess.
Naturally, when you use Carnation in its concentrated form, you save
decidedly on butter and cream.

Being always pure and sweet, never varying in richness and high quality
Carnation gives _uniformly dependable_ results in cookery. Being
“homogenized,” Carnation Milk with its unusually fine and evenly
distributed cream particles gives a creaminess, a velvety smoothness, a
fine texture, that even the finest of bottled milk cannot equal. Soups
and sauces, candies and cakes, ice creams, custards, puddings, waffles
and griddle cakes are among the many dishes to which Carnation gives
this notably smooth, delicate texture.

Among home economics experts Carnation Milk has an extremely wide
acceptance. These women, to whom cooking is both a science and an art,
choose Carnation not only for the definitely improved quality which it
gives to so many dishes, but because its convenient and dependable form
and its freedom from waste, are in keeping with modern standards of
efficiency in the kitchen.

_Carnation as a Baby Food_

Our best baby food, of course, is mother’s milk. But if a baby can not
have mother’s milk, then Carnation is recommended, modified according to
the physician’s directions. The tiny butter fat globules, evenly
distributed, make Carnation Milk easy for the baby to digest. Then too,
because of the heat of sterilization, the curd formed in the stomach is
softer and more easily digested than that formed by raw milk.

You can get Carnation anywhere, take it anywhere, with the utmost
confidence that the milk’s purity and controlled uniformity will protect
the baby from upsets so often caused by milk of changing and uncertain
quality. If you would like more information about Carnation for baby
feeding, I will gladly send you one of our interesting folders, which
deals with this subject.

_Now Try Carnation_

The recipes which follow have been perfected in our own kitchen, to
insure your obtaining the superior results which the quality of
Carnation Milk makes possible.

Order Carnation today from your grocer and prepare to enjoy “the delight
of the _new_ in cookery.”

CARNATION MILK FOR BETTER COOKING

GENERAL DIRECTION

_Making Accurate Measurements_

In order to insure perfect results measurements should be accurately
made and directions carefully followed. Use standard measuring cups and
spoons and make all measurements absolutely level. In order to do this
fill the cup or spoon and then level with a knife. Half, quarter, and
third cupfuls are indicated by marks on the cup. To measure a half
spoonful, fill the spoon, level, and then divide lengthwise. To measure
a quarter spoonful divide the halves crosswise.

Flour should always be sifted once before measuring.

In measuring butter and other solid fats, pack solidly. When the recipe
calls for a certain amount of butter melted, measure before melting.
When it calls for melted butter, measure after melting.

_Standard Measurements_

tsp. teaspoon
tbsp. tablespoon

3 tsp 1 tbsp.
16 tbsp 1 cup
2 cups 1 pint
2 pints 1 quart
2 cups solid fat 1 pound
2 cups gran. sugar 1 pound
2⅔ cups powdered sugar 1 pound
2⅔ cups brown sugar 1 pound
4 cups flour 1 pound
1 sq. bitter chocolate 1 ounce

_Precautions to be Observed in Heating Milk_

Since milk scorches very easily it is advisable to heat it in a double
boiler. If heated directly over the fire the heat should be low or an
asbestos mat should be placed under the pan. If a double boiler is not
used the milk requires careful watching and stirring to prevent
scorching.

_The Use of Carnation as Cream or Milk_

If you wish to use Carnation in place of cream, use it undiluted. Used
as milk, dilute it with an equal amount of water. Use half Carnation and
half water in any recipe calling for milk.

_Soups_

[Illustration: Soups]

Cream soups make a delightful addition to the diet and provide a
splendid way to include more milk. They also are an excellent means of
using left over vegetables, vegetable water, and the liquid from canned
vegetables. Cream soups not only stimulate the appetite, causing the
digestive juices to flow more freely, but also are very nutritious.
Because Carnation Milk is rich and creamy it is the secret of the
creaminess of these soups.

_Garnishes for Cream Soups_

What a magic effect a little garnishing has and how easily it converts a
simple dish of soup into one that is deliciously attractive! The
following garnishes are all suitable for cream soups:

Vegetables cut in fancy shapes
Dash of paprika
Bit of chopped parsley
Little grated cheese
Spoonful of whipped cream
Spoonful of puffed rice
Croutons
Toasted cheese sticks
Squares of custard

CREAM OF TOMATO SOUP

1 can of tomato soup
1 tall can of Carnation Milk

Heat the milk and the tomato soup in different pans but at the same
time, watching carefully to prevent scorching. When both are piping hot
(not boiling) and you are ready to serve, pour the hot tomato into the
hot Carnation and serve immediately. To avoid curdling be sure to pour
the tomato into the milk instead of vice versa. Do not combine the
tomato and milk until ready to serve as these should be heated
separately. This makes a thick and delicious soup. Serves 4.

drippings until well browned. Add water to half cover the meat and cook
slowly about 40 minutes or until tender. Take birds out of pan and
remove skewers or cord. Add Carnation to the juice in the pan and heat.
Pour this gravy over the birds and serve at once. Serves 5.

CARNATION MILK FOR CREAMING VEGETABLES

_Vegetables_

Serving vegetables in an attractive form is an important part of cookery
because of the value of vegetables in the diet. They add the necessary
bulk, some contain energy yielding material, some furnish tissue
building material, but their greatest value lies in their rich mineral
and vitamin content, both of which are essential for growth and for
health. Doctors and dietitians advise the daily serving of at least two
vegetables besides potato, one of these to be served in the raw form, as
in a salad.

In order to prevent loss of minerals and destruction of vitamins it is
best to cook the vegetables in the shortest time possible and in a small
amount of water. Since the water in which vegetables are cooked or
canned is rich in minerals it should never be discarded. It can be used
for soups and for creaming the vegetables.

SPINACH AU GRATIN

3 tbsp. butter
3 tbsp. flour
½ tsp. salt
⅛ tsp. pepper
½ cup Carnation Milk
1 can Spinach (No. 2)
¾ cup Spinach liquid
¼ cup grated cheese
Stir ½ cup dried bread crumbs in 2 tbsp. butter, melted

Melt the butter; add flour and seasonings and mix thoroughly; add
Carnation and the liquid drained from the can of spinach. Stir
constantly until smooth and thick. Add the grated cheese and as soon as
this is melted add the spinach. Put the mixture into a casserole, cover
with buttered bread crumbs and put in the oven for 10 minutes or until
the crumbs are browned. Serves 5.

SCALLOPED CABBAGE

1 medium head of cabbage
3 slices of broiled bacon
1 cup of White Sauce No. 2 (see page 7)
½ green pepper
½ cup bread crumbs stirred in
2 tbsp. melted butter

Cut cabbage in quarters, cook in boiling salted water (using 1 tsp. salt
to 1 quart water) until tender—about 15 minutes. Cut the broiled bacon
in small squares, dice the green pepper, and add both to the white
sauce. Put alternate layers of cabbage and white sauce in a casserole,
shaking salt over each layer of cabbage before adding the white sauce.
Cover the top layer with buttered crumbs and brown in a moderate oven.
Serves 6.

CORN SOUFFLE

3 tbsp. butter
4 tbsp. flour
1 tsp. salt
⅛ tsp. pepper
¼ tsp. celery salt
½ cup Carnation Milk
½ cup water
1 cup canned corn
2 tbsp. chopped pimiento
3 eggs

Make white sauce of the butter, flour, seasonings, and Carnation diluted
with the water. Add the corn, pimiento, and beaten egg yolks. Fold in
beaten egg whites and pour into buttered baking dish; bake in a slow
oven until firm (about 30 minutes). Serves 5.

[Illustration: CREAMED VEGETABLES]

CREAMED VEGETABLES

Use 2 cups of vegetable to one cup of white sauce No. 2 (see page 7). In
making the white sauce use the water in which the vegetables have been
cooked, rather than plain water. Pour the white sauce over the
vegetables and mix gently with a fork so as to preserve the dices,
squares, strips, or slices of vegetable. Variety may be obtained by
adding grated cheese, diced pimiento, shredded green pepper, chips of
broiled bacon, or celery salt to the white sauce.

STUFFED BAKED POTATO

6 medium sized potatoes
2 tbsp. butter
1 tsp. salt
½ tsp. pepper
2 tbsp. Carnation Milk
2 tbsp. water
1 egg white
2 tbsp. grated cheese

Bake potatoes in a hot oven for 45 minutes or until soft. Remove from
oven and cut off the top third of each; then scoop out insides. Mash
potatoes, add seasoning, and then the Carnation and water heated
together; beat well; add egg white well beaten. Refill potato shell;
sprinkle top with grated cheese and put into a hot oven to brown. Serve
at once. Serves 6.

BAKED CAULIFLOWER

1 medium cauliflower
1 cup white sauce No. 2 (see recipe page 7)
⅓ cup bread crumbs stirred in
1 tbsp. melted butter

Remove leaves and trim off stalk from the cauliflower. Soak in a
solution of 1 tbsp. vinegar, 1 tsp. salt, and 1 quart of cold water for
5 minutes to remove dirt and insects. Cook whole, stem up, in boiling
salted water until tender (about 10 minutes). Put cauliflower in a
buttered baking dish, pour the white sauce over it, and cover with
buttered bread crumbs. Brown in a moderate oven. Serves 6.

_Salads_

[Illustration: Salads]

Salads served crisp and cold add zest and variety to any meal. The
secret of an attractive salad is to have all of the ingredients
thoroughly chilled and drained. In combining them use a fork, mixing
carefully so as not to mash the ingredients. Add the dressing just
before serving.

TOMATO SALAD

6 tomatoes
1 head of lettuce
Mayonnaise

Select tomatoes of good shape and color. Peel and cut 3 thin slices off
the top of each tomato and arrange on lettuce on salad plates. Cover
slices and top of tomato with mayonnaise (see page 14); sprinkle with
paprika.

If desired, the inside of the tomato may be scooped out and the cup
sprinkled with salt. Then invert and chill; when ready to serve add a
chicken filling made by combining 1 cup chopped chicken, ½ cup diced
celery, and ⅓ cup nuts with mayonnaise. Or a vegetable filling may be
made by combining diced tomato, ¾ cup of diced celery, ⅓ cup nuts, and ½
cup chopped olives or sweet pickles with mayonnaise. Serves 6.

STUFFED CELERY

6 stalks celery
⅔ cup cream cheese
2 tbsp. Carnation Milk
¼ tsp. salt
1 tsp. onion juice
Paprika
Mayonnaise
1 tsp. chopped green pepper
Lettuce leaves

Select crisp stalks of celery having deep grooves. Add milk and
seasoning to the cream cheese. Pile mixture securely into the grooves of
celery, leaving a fluffy, rough surface. Cut into 4 inch lengths. Select
a small crisp celery tip and place into one end. Sprinkle with paprika
and lay two or three stalks on a lettuce leaf. Serve with mayonnaise
(see page 14). Serves 6.

CARNATION MAKES THE DRESSING CREAMY

PEACH SALAD

6 peaches
Lemon juice
2 tbsp. Carnation Milk
½ cup cream cheese
Lettuce leaves
½ cup mayonnaise

Peel and cut peaches in half (or use halves of canned peaches). Sprinkle
with lemon juice to prevent discoloring. Place 2 halves on lettuce leaf
on each salad plate. Soften cheese with the Carnation Milk and combine
with the mayonnaise. Put mixture into a pastry bag and fill the hollows
of peaches leaving a rose on top, or simply fill carefully with a spoon.
Serves 6.

CARNATIONNAISE
(Mayonnaise)

4 tbsp. flour
1 tbsp. sugar
1 tbsp. mustard
1 tsp. salt
Paprika
1 cup salad oil
⅔ cup Carnation Milk
¼ cup cider vinegar
¾ cup water
1 egg

Mix dry ingredients and to this add gradually ¼ cup of salad oil, ¼ cup
of cider vinegar, and ¾ cup of water. Stir until smooth. Cook over a
slow fire until thick and the flour is well cooked, stirring constantly.
Remove from fire and beat into the mixture 1 egg (which has been
slightly beaten), ⅔ cup of Carnation Milk, and ¾ cup of salad oil. Add
the milk and oil slowly and beat very smooth. This makes 3 cups of
mayonnaise. It will keep indefinitely.

FRUIT SALAD DRESSING

Carnationnaise is delicious for fruit salads. If a creamier dressing is
desired combine ½ cup whipped Carnation (see directions page 31) and 1
cup of Carnationnaise.

THOUSAND ISLAND DRESSING

2 cups Carnationnaise
½ cup Chili sauce
1 tsp. finely cut onion
3 tbsp. diced pimiento
3 tbsp. diced green pepper

Excellent with any vegetable salad.

NO EGG MAYONNAISE

½ tsp. salt
Few grains pepper
½ tsp. mustard
½ tsp. sugar
¼ tsp. paprika
2 tbsp. Carnation Milk
½ cup salad oil
1 tbsp. lemon juice or vinegar

Mix dry ingredients with Carnation. Add oil gradually, beating
constantly. Add lemon juice or vinegar and beat until smooth. This makes
⅔ cup of dressing.

COOKED SALAD DRESSING

1 tsp. mustard
1 tsp. salt
Dash cayenne
2 tbsp. sugar
1½ tbsp. flour
½ cup Carnation Milk
2 egg yolks, beaten
½ cup water

_Cakes_

[Illustration: Cakes]

The secret of making a light, feathery cake of velvety smoothness lies
in the selection of materials of good quality, accurate measurements,
and correct blending of ingredients. Always sift the flour once before
measuring. Carefully follow the directions given for combining
ingredients. To obtain a level cake it is well to push the dough toward
the corners of the pan before putting the cake in the oven. When the
cake is well browned, shrunken from the edge of the pan, and when the
dough springs back quickly if slightly dented in the center, the cake is
done.

CARNATION IS PURE MILK, DOUBLE RICH

_Pastry_

Home made pies “like mother used to make”! Doesn’t that anticipation
make your mouth water? And really, pastry making is not such a difficult
culinary task if the following precautions are observed.

Keep all ingredients as cold as possible. If the fat is rubbed into the
flour with the fingers, use quick and light motion for if the fat is
melted the crust will be tough. Use the minimum amount of water needed
to hold the dough together. Chilling the dough before rolling makes it
easier to handle and also lighter. Roll just enough dough for one crust
at a time. Use quick light motion, from the center outward so as to keep
the shape round.

Do not grease the pie tin. Fit dough smoothly to pie tin so no air is
enclosed. If crust is to be baked before the filling is added, the pie
tin may be inverted and the dough fitted on the outside. Handle dough as
little as possible. Bake in hot oven (450°F).

PLAIN PASTRY

2 cups pastry flour or 1¾ cups bread flour
½ cup cold fat
1 tsp. salt
Approximately ⅓ cup cold water

Sift flour and salt; cut or rub in shortening; add the cold water
gradually, adding just enough to hold the dough together. Let chill for
20 minutes. Divide dough in two parts and roll out to ⅛ inch thickness
on a slightly floured board. Line pie tin, crimp edge with thumb and
finger; prick sides and bottom with fork to preserve the shape. Bake in
a hot oven (450°F) for 12 to 20 minutes. For a two crust pie, line the
pie tin with pastry, moisten rim with cold water, add filling and cover
with top crust which has incisions cut in it to allow the escape of
steam. Press edges of upper and lower dough together, trim off excess
and bake in a hot oven (450°F). This recipe makes 2 crusts.

CARNATION MILK FOR CREAMY CANDIES

_Candies_

The candy maker who aspires to make smooth, creamy candy may be
interested in trying the following suggestions:

Use Carnation Milk because it is so rich and creamy. Carnation makes
especially delicious candy because of its homogenization. In this
process the butter fat particles are finely divided and evenly
distributed. For this reason Carnation blends thoroughly with the other
ingredients and makes an unusually smooth and creamy candy.

Use corn syrup or cream of tartar as these help to keep the candy from
becoming grainy.

While the candy is cooking stir just enough to prevent scorching. Too
much stirring is liable to make the candy grainy.

After the candy is cooked let it stand until it is almost cold. Then
beat vigorously until it is thick and creamy.

CARNATION FUDGE

2 tbsp. butter
2 sq. chocolate
3 cups sugar
2 tbsp. corn syrup (light)
½ cup Carnation Milk
½ cup water
1 tsp. vanilla
Chopped nuts, if desired.

Melt butter and shaved chocolate in a sauce pan; add sugar, corn syrup,
and Carnation diluted with the water. Cook until mixture forms a soft
ball in cold water or reaches a temperature of 235°F, stirring
occasionally to prevent sticking. Remove from fire and let stand until
cool. When cool add vanilla and beat until creamy; add chopped nuts and
mold on a buttered plate. FUDGE BALLS may be made by forming the candy
into balls and rolling in chopped nuts, cocoanut, grated chocolate, or
dipping in melted chocolate. MARSHMALLOW FUDGE may be made by adding 1
cup of cut marshmallows instead of the nuts.

PEANUT BUTTER FUDGE

2 cups sugar
2 tbsp. corn syrup
⅓ cup Carnation Milk
⅓ cup water
2 tbsp. peanut butter
½ tsp. vanilla
½ cup chopped peanuts, if desired.

Cook sugar, corn syrup, and Carnation diluted with the water. When it
reaches the soft ball stage, remove from fire and add peanut butter.
When cool add vanilla and beat until creamy. Mold on a buttered plate.

CREAM CARAMELS

2 cups sugar
2 cups corn syrup
½ cup butter
¼ tsp. salt
2 cups Carnation Milk
1 tsp. vanilla

Cook sugar, syrup, salt, and butter until the mixture reaches a clear,
thick consistency. Stir in gradually the Carnation Milk. Cook until it
forms a firm ball in cold water (240°F), stirring constantly to prevent
sticking. Add vanilla and pour into buttered pans. When cold remove from
pan and lay on an oiled bread board. With a long sharp knife and using a
saw-like motion cut into inch cubes. Wrap each piece in waxed paper.

_Miscellaneous_

[Illustration: Miscellaneous]

Among the following miscellaneous recipes you will find several
excellent luncheon or supper dishes. The delicious griddle cakes and
waffles will be a treat for any meal.

WELSH RAREBIT

2 tbsp. butter
2 tbsp. flour
½ tsp. salt
¼ tsp. mustard
Few grains cayenne
½ cup Carnation Milk
½ cup water
1 egg
½ lb. American cheese

Make a white sauce of the butter, flour, seasonings, and Carnation
diluted with water. Add finely cut or grated cheese and stir until
melted. Pour hot sauce on beaten egg and mix well. Serve hot on toast.
Serves 4.

CARNATION SANDWICH FILLING

1 cup Carnation Milk
½ pound American Cheese (Best to use a package cheese wrapped in tin
foil.)
½ can pimiento (small size)
Salt and paprika

Cut cheese in small pieces and add to milk in a double boiler. Heat
until the cheese is melted and the mixture is creamy. Remove from the
fire immediately, add chopped pimientos, salt, and paprika. This makes a
very tasty sandwich spread; it is also delicious served on toast or
crackers or used in salads. Keep in a cool place; if too thick when
wanted, add more milk and stir well. Makes about 1 pint.

BAKED EGGS A LA CARNATION

1½ tbsp. butter
1½ tbsp. flour
½ tsp. salt
¼ tsp. pepper
½ cup Carnation Milk
½ cup water
4 to 6 eggs
Buttered bread crumbs

Make a white sauce of the butter, flour, seasonings, and Carnation
diluted with the water. Pour into a shallow baking dish. Cover the sauce
with the eggs, being careful not to break the yolks. Sprinkle buttered
bread crumbs over the top and bake in a moderately slow (325°F) oven
until eggs are firm. Garnish with parsley.

CARNATION MAKES BETTER BREAD

YEAST BREAD

2 tbsp. shortening
2 tbsp. sugar
2½ tsp. salt
1 cup boiling water
1 cake compressed yeast dissolved in ¼ cup lukewarm water
⅓ cup Carnation Milk
⅔ cup water
7½ cups bread flour, approximately

Put fat, sugar, and salt in a large bowl and pour over it the boiling
water and Carnation diluted with ⅔ cup water. When lukewarm (98°F) add
the dissolved yeast and 7 cups of flour; stir until thoroughly mixed.
Turn dough on to a slightly floured board, knead 10 minutes or until
smooth and elastic, adding flour as needed. Put into a bowl, cover and
let rise in a warm place (85°F) until double in bulk. Knead dough in the
bowl for one minute and again let rise until double in bulk. Cut in half
and shape into smooth loaves; place them in a greased pan to again rise
until double in bulk. Moisten top with diluted Carnation and place in a
hot oven (425°F). Bake about 35 minutes. Makes 2 loaves.

CLOVER LEAF ROLLS

3 tbsp. butter, melted
1 yeast cake dissolved in ¼ cup lukewarm water
⅔ cup Carnation Milk
7½ cups bread flour, approximately
2 tbsp. sugar
2 tsp. salt
1⅓ cups hot water

Add melted butter, sugar, and salt to hot water and Carnation. When
lukewarm add the dissolved yeast and mix thoroughly; add flour until
dough is stiff enough to knead. Knead for 10 minutes or until dough is
smooth and elastic. Let rise in a warm (85°F) place for about 2
hours—until the dough recedes when the hand is thrust into it. Knead
dough in the bowl for one minute and again let rise for about 20
minutes. Take small bits of dough, shape into tiny balls and place 3
balls into each greased section of a muffin tin. Let rise until bulk has
doubled—about 45 minutes. Bake in a hot (425°F) oven.

CINNAMON ROLLS

Use same dough as for Clover Leaf Rolls. When it is ready to be put in
tins roll it to ½ inch thickness, brush with melted butter, sprinkle
with a mixture of ½ tbsp. cinnamon, ¼ cup sugar and ½ cup raisins. Roll
as a jelly roll. Cut in ¾ inch slices and put into a greased pan. Let
rise until the size is doubled. Bake in a hot (425°F) oven for about 20
minutes.

GRIDDLE CAKES

2¼ cups flour
¼ cup cornmeal
4 tsp. baking powder
¼ cup sugar
1 egg, well beaten
⅔ cup Carnation Milk
1⅓ cups water
4 tbsp. fat (melted)
1 tsp. salt

Sift the dry ingredients; dilute the Carnation with the water; add
beaten egg to the milk and melted fat. Stir liquid quickly into the dry
ingredients. Pour or dip batter out carefully on the hot lightly greased
griddle. When the cakes are puffed, full of bubbles, and brown on the
edges turn and cook the other side. The griddle should be hot enough so
that a cake will brown on one side in 2 minutes.

_Table Setting and Service_

When setting the table for luncheon or dinner, lay a plate for each
person served. At the right of each plate place an oyster fork, soup
spoon, and knives in the order they are to be used, the one first used
farthest from the plate. At the left of the plate lay the forks in the
order used, the one farthest from the plate to be used first. Always
have the tines of the forks and the bowls of the spoons turned upward
and the cutting edges of the knives turned toward the plate.

Place a napkin, folded, at the left of the fork; or when soup is served,
the napkin may be folded and placed on the plate with a roll or small
piece of bread partly folded within it. Set the glass for water above
the knife.
