THE STEPS TO FOLLOW

[Illustration: untitled]

[Illustration: untitled]

1. Prepare Fruit: Select fully ripe fruit. Wash, then prepare exactly as
recipe directs. If fruit lacks tartness add ¼ cup lemon juice when
adding sugar. For separating juice for jelly, use 1-yard square of
Canton flannel, spread over colander. Place prepared fruit in cloth,
bring corners together and twist while pressing down on bag. To make
jellies from dripped juice, use twice amount of fruit called for in
recipe.

[Illustration: untitled]

[Illustration: untitled]

2. Prepare Glasses: Wash, scald, and drain the glasses and tin covers
needed, and melt paraffin in a small pot over hot water while making
jelly or jam. Use new paraffin; old paraffin often causes spoilage. If
tin covers are not available, cut out circles of paper to paste over
tops of glasses.

[Illustration: untitled]

[Illustration: untitled]

3. Measure Sugar and Fruit: Use the same standard measuring cup, holding
½ pint, level full, for both sugar and fruit. If sugar is weighed, weigh
fruit also. To measure fruit for jam, pack solidly into cup until juice
and fruit come to top. If there is a slight shortage, fill last cup, or
fraction of cup, with water. If not quite enough juice for jelly, mix
water with pulp in jelly bag and squeeze again.

[Illustration: untitled]

[Illustration: untitled]

4. Cook Rapidly: For quickest jelly making, use an aluminum kettle or
saucepan—6 to 8 quart size. The kettle or saucepan should be less than
one-half full of sugar and fruit to permit a _full rolling boil_, a boil
which cannot be stirred down. Use hottest flame. If fire is slow, keep
kettle covered after sugar is dissolved until mixture comes to a boil.
Stir while coming to a boil, and while boiling.

[Illustration: untitled]

[Illustration: untitled]

5. Add Certo: For _jelly, add Certo as soon as fruit juice and sugar
mixture comes to a boil_; then bring to a full rolling boil and boil
hard for exactly ½ minute, stirring constantly. For _jam_, cook fruit
and sugar mixture at full rolling boil for exactly 1 minute, stirring
constantly; then _remove from fire and stir in Certo_. Time boil by the
clock.

[Illustration: untitled]

[Illustration: untitled]

6. Skim, Pour, Paraffin: Skim jelly and pour directly from saucepan into
clean, freshly scalded glasses. Skim and stir jam for 5 minutes by
turns. This cooling helps prevent floating fruit. Ladle into glasses.
Leave ½-inch space at top of each glass. Cover at once with ⅛ inch of
hot paraffin. When cool, cover glasses with scalded tin covers or
tightly pasted paper covers. Be sure to store in cool, dry place.

New Certo Users: Read carefully pages 4, 5, 17, 18, 31.

TO MAKE JELLY and JAM TOGETHER

The recipes on this page and the next show how to make both jelly and

IMPORTANT DO’S AND DON’TS FOR JELLY MAKERS

DON’T—double Certo recipes. Better color and flavor and more certain
results are obtained from single batches.

DO—use fully ripe fruit of the best possible color and flavor. Taste
fruit, and if it lacks tartness, add the juice of 2 medium lemons (¼
cup) when adding sugar.

DO—prepare fruit exactly as the recipes direct. Do not simmer before
crushing or squeezing unless recipes specify cooking. For crushing
fruit, a food chopper is convenient.

DO—measure sugar and fruit exactly with the same standard ½-pint
measuring cup, level full; or weigh both. A standard measuring cup holds
½ pint sugar (7 oz. by weight) or ½ pint fruit or juice (8 oz. by
weight).

DO—use a large enough kettle so that your mixture has room enough to
boil _hard_. A kettle of 6- to 8-quart capacity is recommended. If the
6-quart size is used for jam, add ¼ teaspoon butter with sugar to reduce
foaming.

DON’T—confuse a gentle simmering boil with the _full rolling boil_
specified in Certo recipes. A full rolling boil is a high, tumbling boil
that cannot be stirred down.

DO—time the full rolling boil by the clock.

DO—stir and skim jams by turns for just 5 minutes before pouring. This
slight cooling helps prevent floating fruit.

DON’T—expose jellies and jams to dust or dampness after they are made.
Spoilage is caused by the growth of yeast and mold plants, which are
usually carried by dust. Use clean glasses, new paraffin, and clean
covers. Paraffin hot jelly and jam at once. Fill glasses only to within
½ inch of top. Store in a cool, dry place.

DON’T—judge the texture of your jellies or jams too hastily. Certo
recipes are designed to give an ideal set at the time they are most apt
to be used. Many grow progressively firmer for a week to a month after
they are made.

NEWS ABOUT PECTIN

Do you know that pectin, which helps you make delicious jams and
jellies, plays a role in medicine, too?

DOCTORS have long used apple pectin in the treatment of
diarrhea—especially with young children. Good results here have led to
further discoveries of the effectiveness of pectin in the treatment of
many intestinal disorders and also in the dressing of wounds and burns.
Pectin made by the makers of Certo is being used in several of these
scientific studies.

BECAUSE this is a subject of active scientific interest, it seems to us
news in which you might be interested. These facts are given solely as a
matter of information. The makers of Certo wish neither to prescribe nor
recommend.

BLACKBERRY JAM

DEWBERRY JAM
CRUSHED STRAWBERRY JAM
YOUNGBERRY JAM

PERFECT JAMS AND JELLIES

Have you ever stopped to think why certain jellies and jams walk off
with the blue ribbons in jelly-contests and win cheers from all the
family ... just what does stand for perfection in a jelly or a jam?

The Bureau of Home Economics “Score Card for Jelly” rates jellies for
flavor, texture, and color, and gives 78% of a score of 100 for perfect
flavor and texture. Flavor is defined as “free from excessive sweetness,
acid, or overcooked flavor”; perfect texture is “jelly that holds its
shape when turned onto a plate, but quivers when the plate is moved.”

Why Certo Recipes Win

Certo jelly recipes are developed with fully ripe fruit instead of the
under-ripe fruit commonly used in old-fashioned jelly making. They take
you a long way toward perfect flavor. And Certo jelly recipes are
designed to give best texture at the time the jelly is most apt to be
used. They take account of the fact that many jellies grow progressively
firmer for a week to a month after they are made.

About the ideal texture for jams there is far less agreement than for
jellies. Some prefer jams that hold their shapes, others like softer
jams. Either texture may be had with Certo jams. If a jam seems stiffer
than desired, break it up with a fork before turning out of the glass.

_The Short-Boil Method_: Scores of state fair champions in jam and jelly
making and millions of other jelly makers, too, use Certo and the
short-boil method of jelly making. They know they can depend on Certo
for sure results, time and money saving, and better, richer-flavored
jams and jellies.

You may find that Certo recipes call for more sugar than you usually
use. Remember that with Certo no fruit juice boils away in steam and you
usually get half again more glasses. Thus the extra sugar takes care of
the extra juice.

HOW TO MAKE JAMS AND JELLIES WITH CERTO
_using 25% to 50% less sugar_

In any Certo recipe, 2 cups (1½ lbs.) of light corn syrup may be
substituted for 2 cups (14 oz.) of sugar required. Results will not be
satisfactory if more than 2 cups of corn syrup are used.

MRS. A SHOWS MRS. B THAT CERTO PAYS FOR ITSELF

Mrs. A and Mrs. B both wanted to make some raspberry jam. Each had 2
quarts of berries to begin with and after cleaning and crushing them
each got the same amount of prepared fruit—4 cups.

Both Mrs. A and Mrs. B {9 o’clock} started at 9 o’clock.

Mrs. A added 6½ cups of sugar to her fruit. Then Mrs. A simply brought
her fruit and sugar to a tumbling boil, boiled for 1 minute, removed it
from the stove and added ½ bottle of Certo. The jam was done and it had
all of the flavor of fresh, ripe fruit.

{uncaptioned}

Mrs. A was finished at 9:12.

{9:12}

Mrs. B added 4 cups of sugar. Then Mrs. B, following the old-fashioned
“cup for cup” recipe, had to boil her fruit and sugar about 30 minutes
before the jam thickened. This long boiling evaporated more than a third
of the prepared fruit and carried off most of the natural fresh fruit
flavor in steam.

{uncaptioned}

Mrs. B was finished at 9:45.

{9:45}

Mrs. A got 10 glasses of jam from her 2 quarts of berries.

{uncaptioned}

Mrs. B took 3 times as long and got only 6 glasses of jam.

{uncaptioned}

Mrs. A had shown Mrs. B exactly what she meant when she said, “Certo
really pays for itself!”
