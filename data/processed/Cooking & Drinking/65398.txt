_All your baking can be perfect_

[Illustration: _Velvet-soft and velvet-fine—every cake_]

What makes a perfect cake? Even rising? Tender brown crust? Delicate
flavor and fragrance? All these qualities and one more—the fine, moist,
tender texture that is hard to describe by any word except “velvety”!

“Velvety crumb”—that is the expression cake judges use in speaking of
the beautiful texture of cakes leavened by Calumet, the Double-Acting
Baking Powder.

See it in this close-up picture of a slice of Calumet cake! Then make
any cake in this book—cut a slice and feel a crumb between thumb and
finger. Soft as velvet! Touch the cut surface. So moist and springy! Now
taste a morsel of the cake. Velvet-fine—velvet-smooth!

Every Calumet cake, plain cake or party cake, dark or light or
golden-yellow, has this same lovely texture—thanks to Calumet’s
dependable Double-Action. Use the recipes in this book, following
Calumet’s thrifty proportion with care, and all your cakes will be
perfect—the envy and admiration of your friends!

[Illustration: _Light, tender, golden brown—every biscuit_]

What makes a perfect biscuit? A little flaky, crusty morsel—and pass the
plate often—that’s the South’s perfect biscuit, while a Yankee biscuit
is fluffy and high as your Grandmother’s comforter. Westerners like
sugar and spice.... New Yorkers have a fondness for the old-world flavor
of cheese.

But thick or thin, sweet or tangy, the best biscuits the country over
are light and tender biscuits—perfectly leavened biscuits.

Calumet, the modern Double-Acting Baking Powder, will show you the way
to biscuits light as air, delicately brown and tender. And on pages 19
to 20 are tested Calumet recipes, based on Calumet’s marvelously
economical proportion, for any type of biscuit you prefer to make and
serve.

There is an extra touch of perfection in every quick bread made with
Calumet. Muffins are tender, evenly risen, free from humps and from
tunnels. Waffles, griddle cakes, cookies, gingerbread, all owe a new
quality and sureness to Calumet’s Double-Action. Read on and see just
how it works!

CALUMET’S DOUBLE-ACTION
_What it means to your baking!_

First Action

[Illustration: _Just enough leavening in the mixing bowl_]

See Calumet’s First Action. It begins in the mixing bowl when you add
liquid (milk, water, or eggs) to the dry ingredients. The instant liquid
is added, things begin to happen. Thousands of tiny gas bubbles surge
through the batter, making it light and spongy and ready for baking.
BUT—only part of Calumet’s leavening gas is released in the mixing
bowl....

Second Action

[Illustration: _—just enough leavening in the oven_]

Calumet’s Second Action is released by heat. See what happens in the
oven. Steadily, evenly, hundreds of new tiny bubbles swell through the
batter and continue the leavening. Up! ... up! ... they keep raising the
batter and hold it high and light. Thanks to these two scientifically
balanced actions, Calumet Baking Powder protects your baking from start
to finish.

Baking powder is a small part of any given recipe, yet it plays such an
important role that it is often called “the biggest little thing in
baking”. Too much or too little baking powder or baking powder that is
not efficient ... what a lot of baking trouble that can cause! Humped,
uneven cakes ... dry, harsh, coarse-grained cakes ... even flat
failures!

Calumet’s two leavening actions are perfectly timed and balanced to give
maximum protection and superb quality to all your baking. A little of
this Double-Acting Calumet does a superfine job—and this means extra
economy for Calumet users. The usual Calumet proportion is 1 level
teaspoon per cup of sifted flour. This amount is only one-half to
two-thirds the amount recommended for many other baking powders.

Most of the recipes in this book call for this proportion. In some
recipes, however, the number of eggs, the type of flour, or the nature
of other ingredients make advisable slightly more or slightly less. But
every recipe has been tested again and again and has been carefully
built with exactly the right proportions to give you the full advantage
of Calumet’s Double-Action. Follow these recipes accurately, faithfully,
and rejoice in the efficiency and economy of Calumet.

_Such a comfort to busy women!_
CALUMET BATTERS CAN WAIT

[Illustration: _Mix batter ... wrap tightly_]

[Illustration: _Store in a cold place_]

[Illustration: _Bake when you please ... without last minute
bustle_]

Cake Batter on hand in the icebox! Muffin batter! Cooky dough! Ready to
slip into the oven and bake whenever you want them.

Fresh, hot, good things for dinner without the fuss and flurry of last
minute mixing! Three or four hot desserts for week-end meals from one
batter mixing! No more cake failures because of ringing doorbells and
children’s demands just when a batter is ready for the oven.

Calumet batters can wait—for moments or for days! This is another
wonderful advantage that Calumet’s Double-Action brings you. For even
when you store cake batter for days, you can count on perfect lightness
when you bake it.

If baking is to be delayed only an hour or so, slip the bowl or pan of
batter into the refrigerator. To store longer, follow directions below.
Turn to page 11 for a large quantity cake recipe that will give you
batter for three quick desserts—a real Miracle Cake.

1. Mix Calumet batter, pour in pan; cover tightly, first with a damp
cloth, and then with waxed paper. Tie securely.

2. Store batter in a cold place until you are ready to bake. Calumet’s
second action will be held in reserve until the batter reaches the
heat of the oven.

3. Unwrap pans and bake as usual. Results will be perfect—delicately
light, tender, fine and velvety in texture. How delightful to
serve things fresh-baked—hot—delicious, without one bit of
last-minute fuss and flurry ... thanks to Calumet’s remarkable
Double-Action.

REMEMBER THESE POINTS
_whenever you bake._

[Illustration: _Sift flour before measuring—fill cup lightly_]

[Illustration: _Measure baking powder exactly—a level teaspoon_]

_Do_ be orderly. Plan your baking before you start. Choose your recipe,
read it through carefully, understand it clearly. Collect all the
ingredients specified, and arrange them in the order called for in
the recipe; assemble all the utensils needed on your work table.
Cultivate the do-it-right habit.

_Do_ use good ingredients. You can’t do first-rate baking with
second-rate materials. Use fresh, sweet shortening and eggs of
fine quality. Use fine granulated sugar, unless some other kind is
called for in your recipe. Remember that baking powder and flour
are the most important ingredients in baking. Give yourself the
protection and advantages of Calumet, the Double-Acting Baking
Powder ... and of Swans Down Cake Flour, too, whenever the recipe
calls for it. It gives to cakes and to certain quick breads a
fineness and lightness that you cannot expect from ordinary flour.

_Don’t_ use more Calumet than the recipes call for. Calumet’s
Double-Action gives it extra efficiency—less of its leavening gas
is lost from the surface of batters during mixing. Thousands of
tests have proved that the small amounts of Calumet Baking Powder
specified in these recipes will give you best results. One level
teaspoon of Calumet to a cup of sifted flour is the correct
proportion for most recipes. In some recipes the nature of the
ingredients makes advisable slightly more or slightly less.

THESE ARE BASIC RULES
_for surest, best results_!

[Illustration: _A bit of care brings results in preparing pans_]

[Illustration: _Watch your baking temperatures—finally, test the
cake_]

_Do_ measure all ingredients accurately with standard measuring cups and
standard measuring spoons. A standard measuring cup is an accurate
half-pint measure—the equivalent of 16 level tablespoons. It is
grooved on one side to read ¼, ½, and ¾; on the other, to read ⅓
and ⅔. A standard tablespoon is equivalent to 3 standard
teaspoons. Always sift flour once before measuring, and remember
that all standard measurements are _level_.

_Do_ mix carefully. Follow exactly the mixing directions given in each
recipe. The way you combine and handle your ingredients is
important.

_Do_ use the type and size of pans specified in the recipes, and prepare
your pans before mixing. A greased paper lining in pans for large
butter cakes gives added protection.

_Do_ handle cakes carefully, after baking. Place butter cake and pan on
cake rack, for about 5 minutes; then remove from pan, and turn
cake, top side up, on rack to finish cooling. For sponge cakes,
follow directions given in recipes.

_Don’t_ guess about your baking temperatures. If your stove does not
have an oven heat regulator, use a portable thermometer. It does
not control heat, but it does tell you when to adjust the baking
temperature.
