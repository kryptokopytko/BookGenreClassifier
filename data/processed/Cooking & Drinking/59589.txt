MAKE THE MOST OF YOUR SUGAR!

If low on sugar, you can still make these cakes. Follow these
sugar-thrifty tips.

corn sirup, reduce milk to 1/2 cup. Add all of corn sirup (after
dropping in Spry), then 1/2 of milk, and beat 150 strokes. Continue as
in recipe.

_Marbled Spice Cake._ Follow same directions as for Gloria Chocolate
Layer Cake.

_Filigree Devil’s Food Cake._ Use only 3/4 cup sugar, add 1/2 cup dark
corn sirup, reduce milk to 3/4 cup. Add all of corn sirup (after
dropping in Spry), then about 2/3 of milk, and beat 150 strokes.
Continue as in recipe.

_Sugar-Saving Seven Minute Frosting._ Mix in double boiler: 1 egg white,
1/2 cup corn sirup, 2 tablespoons sugar, 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar.
Place over boiling water and beat 7 minutes. Remove from fire and add
desired flavoring. Use this recipe for Golden Jubilee Frosting, Peerless
Frosting, Cherry Fluff Frosting.

_Make cakes that need no frostings_, like the fruity Victorian
Applesauce Cake, nut-laden Party Cake, Orange Upside-Down Cake.

_Make small cakes_, like Fudge Bar Cake.

_Forget side frostings_—frost layer cakes between and on top only ...
frost loaves on top.

_Make Orange Upside-Down Cake_ without topping and serve as Cottage
Pudding.

Light, luscious cakes are one of the best ways in which to “spend” some
of your sugar. Now, more than ever, when you make a cake, you want it to
be the _best_ cake. Sugar—and other ingredients, too—are precious,
sometimes scarce. Get the most out of them by using these tested, sure
recipes. Make the finest cakes you ever made—cakes that are well worth
the cup or two of sugar “saved up for their making.”
