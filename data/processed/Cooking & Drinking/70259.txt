_Season’s Best
Dishes_

for 2 or 4 or 6
By Mary Lee Taylor

_Dear Friend_,

The cookies you make, the candies, the special dishes—even the
very smell of them baking or cooking—are things your family will
remember long after the holidays.

It takes time, of course, to make these good things—but with
the recipes in this booklet, it will take much _less_ time. For
instance, those delicious Butterscotch Balls and Coconut Kisses
are so simple to make there need never be an empty candy jar. If
there’s a “junior” cook at your house, let her try them—she’ll be
so proud of her success.

You will be famous for your cookies when you serve fruity Pineapple
Date Bars, or rich, tender Holiday Crescents—which are merely
shaped into half-moons, not rolled. Mincemeat Cup Cakes are almost
little fruit cakes—and Easy Fruit Coffee Cake is so quickly
made with yeast and biscuit-mix you could have it for a festive
Christmas breakfast.

When friends drop in, entertaining’s easy with Bacon Rarebit—or
with Cheese Chips in the icebox, all ready to slice and bake at a
moment’s notice. I haven’t forgotten your Christmas dinner—there’s
a Potato Stuffing for the holiday bird, a baking chart to make it a
complete success, a delicious vegetable and a new salad dressing.

Perhaps you’re thinking all these good things take extra amounts of
expensive butter and cream. Quite the opposite! Pet Milk actually
_saves_ on _butter_ because it’s whole milk concentrated to double
richness. In fact, you can use it in place of cream for whipped
toppings, desserts and for coffee—at less than half the cost of
cream. Even when mixed with an equal amount of water, Pet Milk is
rich, wholesome milk that costs less generally than ordinary milk.

I know these recipes will help you serve the best of Christmas
treats—and I send them with my wishes for the happiest of holidays.

Sincerely,
_=Mary Lee Taylor=_ (signature)

has cooked long enough. Be sure to take candy off the heat while
testing. Do not use ice cold water._

_Bringing up a Baby?_

[Illustration: Baby head]

The lovable little rascal calls for plenty of attention ...
especially in the feeding department, doesn’t he? And you’ll be
giving him the _right_ kind of attention, when you give your baby Pet
Milk in his formula.

Pet Milk is right for baby, every way. Right, because it’s uniformly
rich in all the important food substances of whole milk. Right,
because it’s so very easy for baby to digest. Right, because it’s
as surely safe in its sealed container as if there were no germ of
disease in the world.

Pet Milk is right, too, because it’s fortified with pure crystalline
vitamin D—the very same kind of vitamin D that bright sunshine would
provide for babies if they could get enough sunshine. It’s the
combination of vitamin D and the calcium and phosphorus so richly
supplied by Pet Milk that helps your baby to develop straight strong
bones, sound teeth ... and to have the best of growth.

No wonder Pet Milk is so right for baby! No wonder doctors all over
America recommend Pet Milk for babies who need to have milk from a
bottle. If you’re bringing up a baby, ask your doctor about Pet Milk.
