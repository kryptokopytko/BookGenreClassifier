Foreword

This booklet on Outdoor Cooking is presented to make outdoor life more
enjoyable for the thousands of campers who take to the open fields,
woodlands, and streams of America each year.

It is written to demonstrate the new aluminum foil way to cook out of
doors ... endorsed by expert campers, camping associations, and rod and
gun clubs throughout the country.

Alert campers who discover new uses for Reynolds Wrap (aluminum foil)
are urged to write the publisher, Reynolds Metals Company, who will try
to include them in subsequent editions of this manual ... thereby
assisting other campers to a happier day afield.

Reynolds Wrap
_What it is and how campers use it_

Aluminum foil, as widely distributed under the name Reynolds Wrap, is
pure aluminum. Reynolds Wrap is available at grocery, drug, department
and other stores throughout most of the U. S.

Aluminum is often called the “miracle metal” ... and it is in the form
of aluminum foil that its miracle properties are most evident.

Housewives line frying pans with it, wrap meat and fowl for roasting,
etc. Campers wrap their food in it and drop the package in the hot coals
of the campfire. They thus eliminate scouring pots and pans and washing
dishes ... the unpleasant chores of camping out.

The heat-reflective property is, again, most dramatically demonstrated
by the foil. It is used by housewives to line broiler pans and reflect
heat upward to broil the underside of a steak (and to save on pan
scouring). At campfires, reflective ovens are constructed of Reynolds
Wrap—to bake bread, biscuits, and even small pies.

Wrapping an object in pure aluminum foil is a unique experience. No
strings, rubber bands, or other fastenings are required ... the wrap
molds to any shape, and holds it. By crimping edges, the package is
sealed against moisture, air, light, and odor. Little wonder it is so
widely used to keep certain foods fresh and moist. On a day’s outing or
overnight hike, campers prepare several meals before they start out,
wrap each in Reynolds Wrap, toss them into their pockets ... and all
that remains is to build a fire and drop the “packaged meal” in the
coals.

Reynolds Wrap cuts down “camp chores” and makes outdoor life more
fun.... See the menus and recipes on the following pages for dozens of
ideas, every one proved at the campfire.

CAUTION:—Obviously, foods and sandwich spreads that normally require
refrigeration must be kept iced to assure positive protection.

Have you ever...?

[Illustration: {Uncaptioned}]

After a hard day of whipping the stream or tramping the woods, have you
ever returned to your base camp to find a pile of greasy, smoky-black
pots and kettles waiting to be scoured? Or have you ever awakened in the
morning to meet the mess of the night before?

Ah, now you remember ... you were in a hurry to get away at break of
day, or the evening darkness fell too soon. You left the cooking
utensils unwashed. So now, before the meal can be prepared, the oatmeal
pot must be scrubbed out and the frying pan scoured clean. It’s
unpleasant work and it takes time. Even the most moderate tempers
sometimes flare up when hunger bites and there is no prospect of
immediate food.

But Reynolds Wrap has solved this problem once and for all. Pots, pans,
and dishes are no longer necessary on a camping trip.

Read the suggestions in this booklet carefully.

Six things to remember for better outdoor cooking

1. A bed of hot coals is the thing. Never use a flaming fire (except
when using a reflector oven).

2. Fold the Reynolds Wrap into a package according to instructions on
Page 7. Practice this several times.

3. Always add shortening, fat, butter, or bacon to package before
cooking.

4. Cooking times will vary with wind strength, type of firewood, and
many other factors. All the times given in this booklet are
approximate, of course—a campfire has no thermostat.

5. It’s a good idea to turn a package at approximately half its cooking
time.

6. Package must be crimped carefully for complete sealing to keep in
moisture ... to assure “pressure cooking.”

How to wrap food before cooking

[Illustration: {Uncaptioned}]

This explanation is of utmost importance and must be followed closely
for the best results in cooking. All cooking is done in DOUBLE foil
envelopes.

1. Place item to be cooked on a sheet of Reynolds Wrap. Wrap should be
big enough to allow for a three-fold crimping of open edges.

2. Next fold in half and crimp the three open edges. Make three folds on
these edges. This makes an air-tight envelope.

3. Take another sheet of Reynolds Wrap the same size as the first,
repeat process, making a double layer around the food.

4. This package is placed right on the coals. When the food is cooked,
the three crimped edges can be torn off in zipper fashion. The
contents are then eaten from the wrap, doing away with a dish or
plate.

How to build the right kind of fire

[Illustration: {Uncaptioned}]

The right kind of fire for aluminum foil cooking is really no fire at
all, but rather a bed of hot coals. The Boy Scout Merit Badge Book on
cooking explains how to get a bed of coals as follows:

“The camp fire generally supplies a good bed of coals, but sometimes
this is needed in a hurry, soon after camp is pitched. To get it, take
sound hardwood, either green or dead, and split it into sticks of
uniform thickness (say 1¼ inch face). Lay down two bed-sticks, cross
these near the ends with two others, and so on up until you have a pen
or crib a foot high. Start a fire in this pen.

“Then cover the top of the pen with a layer of parallel sticks laid an
inch apart. Cross this with a similar layer at right angles, and so
upward for another foot. The free draft will make a roaring fire, and it
will all burn down to coals together. The thick bark of hemlock, and of
hardwoods generally will soon give you coals for cooking. To keep coals
for a long time cover them with ashes, or with bark which will quickly
burn to ashes.”

Try these camp ideas

In taking lunches from the base camp, Reynolds Wrap will help in two
ways: First, sandwiches, cake, cookies, etc. are wrapped to hold
freshness, to prevent them from getting wet in case of rain. (Be sure
sandwiches do not contain dressing, etc. that normally should be kept
under refrigeration.) Secondly, if a hot meal is desired (some campers
due to health conditions, must have a hot meal at noon) take a chop or a
piece of meat, place it in the wrap with a patty of butter, add slices
of potato ¼ inch thick, onion, carrot or other vegetable sliced and seal
package securely. This package can be put in a camp fire on the trail
and cooked in 15 to 20 minutes.

On a field trip requiring 2 or 3 meals, each meal can be prepared at
home before leaving. It is sealed at home and ready for the fire in a
moment’s notice. Label the meals Lunch, Supper, etc.

If fish or other game is to be cooked in camp in a kettle or frying pan,
line the pan with Reynolds Wrap before cooking, thus eliminating a
“rough” scouring job and, perhaps, fish-tasting sausages the next
morning.

A round, six inch piece of Reynolds Wrap carried in the pack or pocket
can be quickly shaped into a conical drinking cup for a quick refreshing
drink on the trail. This cup can be used over and over again.

There are many campers and woodsmen who camp the year round. The problem
of keeping food from freezing in intense cold is solved by wrapping the
food in Reynolds Wrap, then newspaper and then Reynolds Wrap around the
outside of the package. This applies to canned goods, potatoes, fresh
fruit, liquids, etc.

Many campers protect articles they carry in their pockets by wrapping in
Reynolds Wrap. Matches are protected against dampening, exposed film is
sealed away from light, etc. Small objects are wrapped together so they
can’t get lost.

BREAKFAST
_Individual Quantities_

_Menu_ _Amount_ (Each person)

Stewed Fruit 4 Prunes or Apricots
Oatmeal ½ Cup
Bacon & Eggs 2 Slices of Bacon, 2 Eggs
Toast & Butter 2 Slices of Toast
Coffee—Milk Instant Coffee

DIRECTIONS: An aluminum foil “pot” can be made by forming doubled
Reynolds Wrap around a forked sapling. The size pot will depend upon the
number in the party. Place dried fruit in enough water to cover them,
the night before. A little more water can be added in the morning, if
necessary, also a small amount (2-3 teaspoons) of sugar if desired. The
pot is carefully placed at edge of camp fire. Oatmeal is cooked in a
similar pot. Add ½ cup of oatmeal to each cup of boiling water. Add ¼
teaspoon of salt to boiling water, then stir in oatmeal. When it
thickens it’s ready. Now, shape up a similar pan of doubled foil and
place bacon in it. When it is about half done, drop in 2 eggs. Eggs
should be cooked sunnyside up as it may be difficult for beginners to
turn them. Toast is made by sticking 2 or 3 pencil sized saplings, 10
inches long into the ground near the fire. Hang the slices of bread on
them and don’t forget to turn them—you are not using a “pop up” toaster.

Coffee of the instant type can be made by using another “foil kettle”
but some campers may prefer to use the old fashioned coffee pot.

FISHERMAN’S DELIGHT
_Individual Quantities_

_Menu_ _Amount_

Trout ¾ to 1 lb. Fish
2 Slices Bacon
Steamed Potatoes 1 Med. to Lge. Potato
Buttered Onions 2 Small Onions
Bread, Apple Butter 1 Jar Apple Butter
Coffee, Cookies 4 to 5 Cookies
Canned Peaches 1 Small Can Peaches

DIRECTIONS: Clean and wash the fish and vegetables. Take about 26 inches

Slice potatoes in ¼ inch slices and place on top of fish. Slice onions
in same manner and place around sides and on top of potatoes. Put
another slice of bacon on top of potatoes and onions. Carefully fold
foil and crease over to seal. Now fold in the ends to seal in all
moisture. Caution—do not make a hole in the wrap.

Place dinner on hot coals for 10 minutes. Now take a blunt stick and
turn it over and leave for 10 minutes more. The length of time it is
left in the fire is determined by the size of fish. The larger the fish,
the more time. Only experience can teach this.

Open up your fish dinner and enjoy its sealed-in flavor.

Baking camp bread

One of the highlights of any camping trip can be the baking of camp
bread or hot biscuits. Nothing equals hot biscuits and jam. This
operation is generally misunderstood by the unseasoned woodsman. It is
thought to be quite involved and complicated. Nothing could be further
from the truth. It can be extremely easy. Those who frequent the deep
woods where “store” bread is unobtainable or difficult to transport need
only take any good prepared biscuit mix, and the bread problem is
solved.

Since Reynolds Wrap has come into general use by Campers and Woodsmen
the bread-making job is much easier. You need no cumbersome reflector
oven on the trip. A reflector oven is made in two ways:

1. Take a 24 inch piece of Reynolds Wrap and bend it in the center at a
45° angle. Place on a stone or other flat surface 6 inches above
the ground and close to the edge of a flaming fire. Mix the
biscuit dough using water. This can be done in a paper bag or a
container shaped up from another piece of foil. Grease the bottom
of the reflector oven slightly and shape 2 inch pieces of dough
and place on the bottom of reflector. It is best to rub a small
amount of dry mix on the fingers before shaping the biscuits so
that the dough does not stick to the fingers. Place the oven so
that an intense heat can be felt in front of the oven. When
biscuits have browned on top turn them over by hand for a minute
or two to bake the bottom of the biscuits. The whole baking
operation should not take over 10 minutes if the fire is hot.

2. The second type of oven is built as follows: This is a permanent type
of oven and remains stationary during the camp trip. Locate the
site for your own camp fire. At the very edge of the fire drive 2
stakes an inch in diameter into the ground so they are at least 15
inches above the ground and 18 inches apart. Directly in back of
these stakes and in line with them 16 inches back drive 2 similar
stakes. Now tie cross pieces 9 inches from the ground on both the
front and rear stakes. Stretch a piece of foil across these two
horizontal sticks so it is rigid and tucked in around both sticks.
This is the shelf. Now tie cross pieces on the front stakes six
inches above and six inches below the shelf. Stretch Reynolds Wrap
from the bottom cross piece back around the outside of the shelf
and up to the top cross piece. Tuck it in securely and the oven is
ready for baking. Caution: When heavy articles such as hamburgers,
chops, etc. are placed on the shelf, distribute the weight. Take
care not to overload the shelf. Eight to ten biscuits can be baked
at one time. When the front row is browned, move it to the back
and the back row to the front. (Best results can be obtained with
reflector ovens by using a double thickness of Reynolds Wrap.)

Reynolds Wrap is now standard equipment on all fishing, camping and
hiking trips.

“whole chicken in foil”

Clean a ¾ pound fowl and fasten securely on a green wood spit. Wrap bird
with two wrappings of Reynolds Wrap and press ends firmly on spit to
seal. (Wrap exposed parts of spit to insulate from fire.) Turn
occasionally and cook over coals for one hour and fifteen minutes.
Remove wrap and brown further over coals if desired. The spit should not
be farther than 8-10 inches from the coals. The fact that Reynolds Wrap
is being used will eliminate constant turning as all of the moisture of
the bird is sealed in. It can be left in one position up to fifteen
minutes before turning again.

“roast beef”

A four to five pound boned rolled roast can be cooked as follows:

Secure roast on a green wood spit and wrap with two layers of Reynolds
Wrap. Press ends of wrap firmly against spit to seal. (Wrap exposed
parts of spit with wrap to insulate it from fire.) Turn occasionally and
cook twenty to twenty-five minutes per pound over hot coals. Arrange the
spit so that the roast is not over six to eight inches from the glowing
coals. Unwrap carefully if you want to save the juice. The flavor of
meat cooked in this fashion is far superior to that of meat cooked
without the wrap since all of the juices are sealed in completely. A
large portion of meat such as the above or larger can be exposed to an
intense heat without burning if it is turned occasionally.

seasoning to taste. Seal envelope and cover with another envelope of
foil. Place on hot coals allowing ten minutes on each side for medium
rare steak.

franks in a blanket

Mix prepared biscuit flour as per directions and roll out thin, about ¼
inch. Cut in pieces large enough to surround frankfurter but let the
frankfurter protrude a half-inch or so at each end. Put in double
envelope of Reynolds Wrap and place on a medium fire of coals. Cook for
fifteen minutes turning frequently. This novelty is very tasty and a
grand picnic stunt. It must be remembered, however, to roll the franks
over quite often as they cook. This will keep them from scorching.
