PREFACE.

Of the making of Cookery Books, we are told, there is no end, but the
comparative worthlessness of their contents for practical domestic
purposes is no doubt the reason why there is still as great a demand as
ever for a thoroughly reliable and up-to-date volume.

The little book I now offer to the public, claims to be the _best,
cheapest, and most useful_ Culinary Handbook yet produced, and I
venture to think its contents will fully justify this assertion.

A large proportion of the recipes are my _own compilation_, and all
alike have been _carefully revised and repeatedly tested_.

Every recipe has been arranged with a view to _practical usefulness_,
and may be confidently recommended for _ease of preparation_,
_daintiness_, and _economy_.

Those who once use the “IDEAL COOKERY BOOK,” will afterwards use no
other, not because their years have been shortened by bad cooking and
unwholesome food, but because they recognise in it all the qualities it
claims to possess, and are able by its aid to _realize in the home the
true “Ideal” of the Culinary Art_.

preferred underdone.

Salt and pepper.

Make it into balls or use as stuffing. Bake ½ hour.

the sugar and rum and mix very thoroughly. Put in jars and tie down.

3. Potato Balls.

Mash the potatoes--season with pepper and salt and little chopped
parsley and bind with yolk of egg. Form into balls, dip in egg and
bread crumbs and fry in boiling fat or in the oven--serve hot.

4. Tasty dish of Cold Cooked Beef.

Butter a pie dish and scatter with bread crumbs and chopped parsley.
Arrange layer of slices of beef with pepper and salt. Next, layer of
crumbs, then beef, placing sippets of bread on the top. Pour gravy

mixture, fold over and press together. Fry brown and serve.

6. Breakfast Dish.

crumbs, and fry in boiling fat till brown. Cut in halves and serve.

7. Potato Cakes.

½-lb. fat bacon.
Little parsley.
Grated rind of 1 lemon.
4 eggs.
1-gill of stock.
Pepper and salt.

Boil the eggs hard and cut in slices. Chop the parsley and mix it with
the rind and seasonings. Line a plain mould with pieces of egg at the
bottom. Cut up the veal in neat, square pieces, and put in the mould
in alternate layers with cut-up bacon and sliced eggs, sprinkling each
layer with seasoning. When full, pour in the stock. Cover tightly with
buttered paper, putting a plate and weight on the top. Bake in a slow
oven for 4 hours. Turn out when cold.

in enough water to cover it. Boil the eggs hard and arrange them in a
mould. Add the gelatine to the liquid, and pour the whole into a mould
and put in a cool place to set. There should not be more liquid than
will fill the mould.

27. Gravy for Mutton.

and cut into small pieces. Place it in a pan with sufficient cold water
to cover. Season with pepper and salt, and stew for 1½ hours. Have

part of the gravy. Put on the cover and bake about ¾ of an hour. Use
the rest of the gravy as required. Make the crust according to “Pie
Pastry” recipe.

30. Tasty Dish of Beefsteak.

Take as much beefsteak as is required and place it in an enamelled pie
dish, cover with cold water and put into the oven to stew, placing an
inverted pie dish on the top. Season with pepper and salt. Add more
boiling water as the other evaporates. Stew for 2½ hours, but a quarter
of an hour before dishing up thicken the gravy with flour and water and
let it boil up.

31. Cold Meat Pâtés.

Take the remains of a joint and mince very finely. Place in a basin,
add a little gravy to moisten, and mix well, seasoning with pepper and
salt.

Have ready some patty pans lined with pie pastry, into which put a
portion of the mince, and cover with a pastry lid. Bake until the
pastry is brown, and serve hot on a d’oyley. Put some good gravy in a
tureen to serve with the pâtés.

32. Potted Beef.

Take 1-lb. of second beefsteak and cut into small pieces, and cover
with cold water and put in a pan and stew gently for about 1½ hours.
Put through the mincing machine twice. Place in a basin and add as
much of the gravy as is necessary to moisten slightly. Mix and beat
thoroughly and put into pots, making the surface very smooth. Melt some
butter and pour a little into each pot. Decorate when cold with a sprig
of parsley.

33. Pommes de terre au Lait.

Cut some cooked potatoes into slices and lay them in a pan of warm
milk. Boil for a few minutes, when the milk will become thick. Add a
little butter, parsley, and nutmeg to the contents of the pan and serve
at once.

34. Pommes de terre à L’Écosse.

Take some large raw potatoes and cut them into square shapes. Blanch
them in salt and water, and then scoop out the centre of each potato
with a spoon. Fill up the holes with finely chopped meat or ham. Lay
the stuffed potatoes in a dripping tin, cover with gravy or water and a
little gravy browning. Bake slowly until tender, pouring the gravy over
them from time to time until they present a glacé appearance.

35. Potato Croquettes.

Take some mashed potatoes and add 2-oz. butter, 2 eggs, and ½ teacup of
flour, and a little grated nutmeg. Mix all well together, and if hot,
let it get cold. Form into fingers, cover with egg and flour, and fry
in boiling fat.

36. A dainty way of Cooking an Egg.

Take a large saucer, and rub it with butter, and set it over a pan of
boiling water. Beat an egg lightly with 1 tablespoonful of milk and a
pinch of pepper and salt. Strain into the saucer, cover it, and leave
for 10 minutes to cook.

37. Beef Tea Custard.

Beat a fresh egg, strain into a gill of beef tea, and add salt to
taste. Turn into a small buttered cup, cover with buttered paper, and
steam 20 minutes. The water should not boil. This can be turned out and
eaten either hot or cold.

38. Beef Tea.

Take 1-lb. of steak, neck, or shin of beef. Cut it into small pieces,
put it into a basin, and cover with cold water, leaving for an hour or
two. Place in a double pan or in any pan that will allow the contents
to gently simmer, and simmer for two or three hours, when it will be
ready for use. Add salt and pepper if desired.

39. Dainty way of Serving Mashed Potatoes.

Steam the potatoes for about half an hour, mash well or put through a
potato sieve. Have ready a basin, the bottom and sides of which have
been greased with lard or butter and sprinkled with bread raspings.
Press the potatoes into the basin and turn out into a tureen.

40. Fried Potatoes.

Peel the potatoes and leave whole, unless very large. Place in a
dripping tin, in which there is a depth of an inch of hot dripping,
and put into a fairly hot oven. As the potatoes brown on the one side,
turn on the other. When cooked, which should be in about half an hour,
strain well and serve in a tureen.

41. Ragôut of Mutton and Eggs.

Mince finely any cold mutton and season with pepper and salt. Place
in a dish in the oven and simmer half an hour. Fry as many eggs as

V. CAKES.

A few hints about Cakes.

Unless otherwise specified the general rule in making cakes is to cream
the butter and sugar together, then add the eggs, then flour and baking
powder (mix the baking powder with the flour) and then add fruit or
other ingredients and beat well. If fruit is to be added do not make
the cake very soft, or currants, &c., will be liable to sink, but they
are less likely to do so if previously rubbed in flour.

Always grease cake tins with lard as the cakes will be less liable to
burn than if the tins are rubbed with butter.

Do not open the oven door for at least twenty minutes after cakes are
put in, and then do it very gently as a sudden action will tend to make
a cake sink in the middle.

proportion of the white of egg and water is two to each pound of sugar.

3. Candy Cherries.

Cut off a piece of candy dough and make it into a thin roll about ½
inch wide. Take a sharp knife and cut into small pieces, and roll them
until they are like marbles. Split some crystalized cherries, and press
a marble between each.

4. Almond Creams.

Blanch the almonds, and cover with candy dough. Roughen the sugar with
a fork.

5. Walnut Creams.

Crack the walnuts and cut in halves, using only the perfect ones,
between which put a candy dough marble and press it. Leave to harden.

6. Cream Dates.

10. Chocolate or Coffee Fondant.

Over a clear fire stir together (in enamelled pan) 1-lb. loaf sugar
and a small cup of cold water. When it is melted, mixed, and beginning
to boil, leave alone for 10 minutes. Dip a skewer in, and if a long
silky hair adheres, remove from the fire at once without shaking it,
and leave it till cool. When cool, turn it into a bowl and beat briskly
to a thick cream with a wooden spoon. Knead the paste (like bread)
till it becomes soft and smooth. Flavour with coffee essence or melted
chocolate. Drop on a buttered paper or form into pyramids.

11. Nougat.

Slow fire. Put in a pan ½-lb. sifted sugar dry, no water. When melted,
throw in blanched almonds and a few bitter ones (thoroughly dried and
chopped into rough dice). Stir all together and turn out on a buttered
dish. Work it a little, then roll flat with a greasy rolling pin or
hands. Cut in shapes.

12. Gelées Françaises.

1-oz. gelatine, 1-lb. granulated sugar, nearly 1-pint water,
flavouring. Put the water and gelatine in a pan, and when dissolved add
sugar. Boil fast 25 minutes. Add 1 teaspoonful powdered citric acid, to
give a sharp taste. Pour on three perfectly dry soup plates. Flavour

knife cut into diamond shapes, toss in castor sugar, and spread on
paper to become crisper. These are much better after a few days.

13. Chestnut Bonbons.

½-lb. chestnuts, 2-oz. chocolate, ¼-gill water, 4-oz. sugar, 1 white
of egg. Boil chestnuts till tender, skin and sieve; add sugar and the

stand for 24 hours, then boil till the chips are very tender and clear.
Let this remain until the following day. To every pint of boiled fruit
allow 1¼-lbs. lump sugar. Boil, stirring constantly until the syrup
jellies and the chips are quite clear. Try the jelly on a saucer from
time to time.

Patent Groats.

Take of Robinson’s Patent Groats one tablespoonful, mix with a
wine-glassful of cold water, gradually added, into a SMOOTH paste, pour
this into a stew-pan containing nearly a pint of boiling water, or
milk, stir the gruel on the fire (while it boils) for ten minutes; pour
it into a basin, add a pinch of salt and a little butter, or if more
agreeable, some sugar, and a small quantity of spirits.

When gruel is made for an Invalid, butter had best be omitted.

VIII. BEVERAGES.

1. Apple Wine.

Slice a large, tart, cooking apple without peeling it, also a little
lemon rind. Put all in a pan with 6 lumps of sugar and 1½-pints of cold
water. Let it come slowly to nearly boiling point; draw it back from

of cold water into a smooth paste free from lumps, pour this into a
stew-pan containing one quart of boiling water, stir this over the fire
while boiling for five minutes: then flavour with a small bit of lemon
peel or cinnamon, and sweeten according to taste.

When Robinson’s Patent Barley is used to make a Summer beverage, only
half-an-ounce must be taken. It can be greatly improved by aeration
with the aid of “_Sparklets_.”

3. Ginger Beer.

Put into a deep bowl 1-lb. lump sugar, 1½-oz. bruised ginger, 1 lemon,
sliced and the pips taken out, and ½-oz. cream of tartar. Pour 1
gallon of boiling water over. When milk-warm, take a whisk, and beat
in vigorously ¼-pint Brewer’s yeast, or 1-oz. German yeast mixed to
a liquid with powdered sugar. Whisk well, cover with a cloth, let it
stand 15 hours, skim, strain through a piece of old tablecloth (or do
not strain), and bottle, only half filling the bottles.

2-drms. capsicum, 1-oz. burnt sugar, 2-lbs. lump sugar, 5-qts. boiling
water.

Dissolve the sugar in the boiling water, when nearly cold add the other
things (which should have been mixed together in a jar), and stir often
until cold. Bottle and cork.

5. Lemon Squash.

Juice and rind of 3 lemons, 3-lbs. lump sugar, 1-quart water. Boil till
it forms a clear syrup, and when cold add 2-oz. powdered citric acid.

IX. ADDITIONAL USEFUL RECIPES.

1. To bottle Green Gooseberries.

(_Very Good_).

Make the bottles hot and dry in the oven, then fill with picked fruit,
not too full. Pour boiling water over, covering the berries to the top
of the bottle. Cork down as soon as possible, and keep in a cool dry
place. Any other fruit can be done the same way.

2. Gooseberry Jelly.

½-stone green gooseberries.
2-quarts water.

Boil together to pulp, tie in a coarse cloth and let it drip all night,
then add 1-lb. sugar to each pint of juice. Boil gently ¾-hour, and
pour into pots.

3. Apple Jelly.

Rub the apples, and cut them up without paring or coring them. Put in
a pan and fill with water. Boil 1 hour. Put in a bag and strain. Allow
¾-lbs. sugar to 1 pint of juice, and boil 1 hour. Put a little into a
saucer, and if it jellies it is done. Pour into pots.

4. Cough Mixture.

1d. licorice.
1d. anise seed.
1d. peppermint.
1d. common treacle.
1d. laudanum.

Mix with 1½-pints of cold water and bottle.

5. Pork Pie Pastry.

To every 1-lb. of flour allow 6-ozs. of lard and 1 dessertspoonful of
salt. Rub the lard into the flour, boil some milk and mix to a stiff
paste. Take some cake tins and take out the bottoms and line with the
warm paste. Three parts fill with minced pork and put a cover about 1
inch thick on the top. Make a hole in the centre and decorate. Place in
a fairly hot oven and bake about 2 hours. Brush with yolk of egg just
before they are cooked.

When the pies are cold, pour into the hole in the top some gelatine,
which has been previously dissolved in boiling water.

If better pastry is required, add more lard, or use butter instead.

6. Recipe for Keeping Eggs.

Take a large stew pot, or deep bowl, and put a layer of common salt in
the bottom. Then insert a few eggs with the thin end downwards, and in
such a way that they do not touch each other. Then put another layer of
salt on the top, and repeat the process until the pot is full, having
salt as the top layer. Tie down very tightly, and whenever an egg is
taken out take care to tie down again. Be sure the eggs are fresh, and
have not been much shaken, and they will keep good for months.
