Preface

The English--to their loss--are not a soup-eating nation; and for
the most part, those of us that do care for soups are obstinately
conservative in our tastes. The ordinary restaurant thinks it has
done its duty when ox-tail, mock-turtle and tomato soup have been
included in the bill of fare. Yet the range of soups is very wide, as
the hundred pages of recipes (by no means exhaustive) that follow will
show; and that they may lead some readers to add to the elasticity of
the domestic menu, is the ambition of the compiler. All are good, few
are expensive, and none exotic. I should like it to be understood also
that the directions need not be considered absolutely final. Every
recipe can be made the basis of mild experiment, by slight differences
in the ingredients or quantities. Two final remarks: soup never ought
to be served in large quantities (our tendency in England when we take
it is to take too much); and in the preparation of it the first and
last word is “simmer.”

General Remarks on Stock

Stock is the basis of all soups, except those which the French call
_potages maigres_, which have no meat in them. For clear soups the
stock is a good consommé, which must be made absolutely clear, and
without any fat. For thick white soups, chicken or veal stock is used.
For brown thick soups, a dark stock. For purées, white or brown stock,
according to their colour.

Stock will keep for several days--in winter for a week.

A tea-spoonful of Liebig’s Extract of Meat will greatly improve the
flavour of a poor stock.

_Utensils._--Of special utensils for making soup, porcelain-lined
sauce-pans are the most satisfactory, and should always be used if
possible. There is nothing so good or clean as the large French _pot au
feu_, which can be bought in Soho. Earthenware sauce-pans are also good.

It saves trouble when straining soup to have a large deep bowl or jar,
and a colander or wire sieve which fits perfectly into it.

Wooden or silver spoons should be used.

_The fire._--In making stock it is most important to have a steady
fire, which need not be interfered with, so that an even temperature
may be kept. Stock should be allowed to come slowly to the boil, and
then be set back to simmer so gently that bubbles rise from one side
only of the pot.

_To prepare fresh meat for stock._--Look over the meat carefully. Cut
away any part which is in the slightest degree tainted. Wipe the meat
over with a clean cloth that has been dipped in cold water and wrung
out. Cut the meat off the bones. Cut it into small pieces. Break the
bones. If there is any marrow, take it out and spread it on the bottom
of the pot that is to be used.

_Vegetables._--In hot weather it is better to make stock without
vegetables, as they often turn it sour.

See that all vegetables used are perfectly clean. Cut them in two or
three pieces if to be used for flavouring stock. If they are to be
served with the soup, cut them regularly and carefully to the size
required, and do not cook them in the soup for more than half-an-hour,
or their flavour will be impaired.

Vegetables should be added in the proportion of about one carrot, one
onion (or leek), half a turnip, a piece of celery, to every quart of
stock. In the onion can be stuck a clove.

_Herbs._--To flavour stock with herbs, it is best to use a _bouquet_
(_i.e._ a small bunch of mixed herbs, a sprig or leaf each of sage,
thyme, marjoram bay and parsley). This can be easily taken out of
the soups before serving. If ground herbs are used, add about a
tea-spoonful of mixed herbs to every quart of stock.

_Seasoning._--It is not necessary to season the original stock. In
making it into different soups, the seasoning is of course a matter
of taste; but, roughly speaking, to each quart may be put one small
tea-spoonful of salt, two pepper-corns, or half a salt-spoon of ground
pepper, and one clove.

_To remove fat from stock._--Every particle of fat must be removed from
the stock from which clear soups are to be made. With stock which is
to be thickened it is not so necessary to be particular, as the flour
used for the purpose will absorb a good deal of fat. With broths, which
should be particularly nourishing, it is merely a matter of taste how
much fat is removed.

To remove fat from stock it is best to let it first become quite cold.
The fat will then become quite solid, and can easily be removed with
a knife. To remove the small particles which may still be left, dip a
cloth in hot water, wring it out, and pass it over the stock. It will
absorb all the fat.

If there is not time to allow the stock to cool first, a great deal of
fat can be absorbed by tissue paper, which should be laid over it. Or
it can be strained two or three times through cloths which have been
put in very cold water and wrung out.

_To clarify stock for clear soups._--The addition of a little cold
water to boiling stock will cause the scum to rise quickly. This can
be done several times, and if thoroughly strained the stock should be
clear.

To clarify soup more effectually, although the flavour is not improved
by doing so, the white and shell of an egg are used. To every quart of
stock (and it must be cold) add the white and broken shell of an egg.
Beat together. Put in the pot, stir continually until hot. Then let it
boil, untouched, for about ten minutes. Set back on the oven, throw in
half a cup of cold water, and allow it to stand for ten minutes. Place
a colander over the bowl, and when you are ready to strain the soup,
put over the colander a napkin which has been dipped in very hot water
and then wrung out. Let it drain through slowly, without any pressure,
shifting the napkin gently if any part becomes clogged.

_Straining._--It is well, as I have said, to have a large, deep bowl,
with a colander or strainer that fits tightly into it. Put a napkin or
muslin over the colander, and take the soup out of the sauce-pan with
a cup or ladle. Let it drain about a quarter of an hour without any
pressure.

The napkins and muslin used for straining may be old, but must be fine
and absolutely clean and sweet.

1 lb. bones
3 quarts cold water
2 carrots, 1 turnip
2 stalks of celery
3 onions
3 cloves
Bouquet of herbs

Cut the meat into small pieces. Break the bones. Put three ounces of
butter in a sauce-pan. When melted, add to it one-third of the meat and
the onions sliced. Stew gently until a rich brown. Put with the rest of
the meat, bones, etc., in a sauce-pan. Cover with water. Bring to the
boil. Simmer four hours. Strain.

Clear Brown Stock

2 lbs. shin of beef
1 lb. knuckle of veal
The carcase and bones of a fowl
3 pints of water
1 carrot
1 onion with a clove stuck in it
1 stick of celery
1 piece of parsley
A small bouquet of herbs

Put the bones at the bottom of a sauce-pan. Place the meat, which
should be cut up in small pieces, upon them. Cover with cold water.
Leave the sauce-pan uncovered. Bring to the boil very slowly. When it
boils throw in a half cup of cold water. (This will cause the scum
to rise.) Skim. Bring to the boil again. Throw in a little more cold
water. Skim. Bring to the boil. Add the vegetables. Set back on the
fire, and allow it to simmer gently for three or four hours.

Strain through a napkin into a bowl and allow it to cool.

If required the soup can be further clarified (p. 4).

Consommé

1 lb. veal
The bones and carcases of fowls or game
2 quarts of stock
Vegetables
The white of an egg

Cut away all fat from the meat. Chop it up finely. Put the white of
an egg in a basin. Add to it the chopped meat. Mix them well together
with a silver spoon. Stir in a glass of cold water. Put the meat into a
large sauce-pan. Add vegetables, the bones and carcases of birds. Cover
with two quarts of good stock. Bring to the boil, stirring occasionally
to prevent the meat from sticking to the sauce-pan.

When it boils, set back to simmer gently for three hours. Dip a napkin
in hot water, wring it out, and strain the stock through it into a
basin.

Chicken Stock

1 old fowl
1 quart water
1 carrot
1 stick of celery
1 small onion

Put the fowl and vegetables into a stew-pan, adding the bones or
carcase of another fowl if possible. Cover with cold water, or weak
clear stock. Let it boil up slowly and simmer for three hours. Skim.
Pass the stock through a napkin, and set aside to cool.

Veal Stock

1 lb. knuckle of veal
Chicken bones or carcases
1 quart of water
Vegetables
1 blade of mace
1 clove

Cut up the veal. Break the bones. Add vegetables and spice. Cover with
the water. Bring slowly to the boil. Simmer for two or three hours.
Strain.

Economical Stock for thick Soups, Purées, etc.

An excellent although not very clear stock can be made from odds and
ends of cooked meat and bones. For this purpose there should be an
enamelled pot with a lightly fitting lid, and it should practically be
kept in use continually.

Spread the bottom of the pot with butter, or marrow. Pack in pieces of
meat, bone, gristle, the carcases of birds, two or three vegetables cut
up in small pieces, two cloves, and a bouquet of herbs.

Cover the meat, etc., with cold water. Put on the lid. Heat slowly, and
when it boils set back to simmer for four or five hours.

In preparing meat for this stock, look it over carefully; reject any
piece which is not perfectly good, also all stuffing, skin, smoked or
burnt pieces. A little beef fat can always be retained, but mutton fat
should not be used as it is rank in flavour. Scrape the meat off the
bones, and break the bones in small pieces.

A slice or two of lean ham, the gravy saved from any kind of roast, a
little fresh meat finely chopped will greatly improve this stock.

General Remarks on Soups

_Utensils and Fire._--The remarks on pages 1 and 2 concerning the
utensils and fire for making stock, apply also to the preparation of
soups from stock.

_To thicken soups with flour only._--Mix flour or cornflour with a
little cold water, milk or stock until perfectly smooth. Add more
water or milk. Strain. Pour slowly into the soup, which should be
nearly boiling. Let it come to a boil. Continue boiling for ten
minutes (stirring all the time), or it will taste of flour. About one
table-spoon of flour should be used to thicken each quart of stock.

_To thicken soups with butter and flour (roux)._--Melt some butter.
Skim it till quite clear. Pour it into an earthenware sauce-pan, and
add to it its weight in flour. Work with a wooden spoon until perfectly
smooth. Stir over a fire for a few minutes. Then put it in a moderate
oven. Stir occasionally, and be very particular that it does not colour
or burn. It should be left in the oven from thirty to forty-five
minutes. This thickening, which is called white roux, is used for
white soups. Brown roux for brown soups is made in the same way, but
is left in the oven until slightly coloured. It will keep for some time.

When adding roux to soups it is best first to melt it in a small
sauce-pan, to thin it with a little hot stock, and then to add it
gradually to the soups.

If the roux has not been prepared beforehand, the quantity required can
be made in a short time by cooking the flour and butter together in a
sauce-pan for five minutes for white roux or longer for brown roux. It
should be stirred all the time.

A heaping table-spoon (or more) of roux should be added to every quart
of soup to be thickened.

_Cornflour and roux._--The advantage of roux over cornflour is that the
flour used in preparing the roux having been already cooked, it is not
necessary to continue boiling the soups to which it is added, whereas
cornflour being raw, the soups thickened by it must be boiled for some
little time.

_To colour soups._--The colour of soups can be deepened by using
caramel colouring, or glaze (see next page) (which will also add to
their flavour).

_Caramel colouring._--Put half a pound of brown or white sugar in
an iron sauce-pan, with a table-spoonful of water. Stir over a very
gentle fire until it turns a deep, rich brown colour. Add half a pint
of boiling water. Let it simmer very gently for twenty minutes. Allow
it to get cold. Put it into bottles and cork. This makes an excellent
and tasteless colouring, but it must be carefully made. The rich brown
colour comes from slow and gentle cooking. If it is burnt and black it
is useless.

Add to the soup a few minutes only before serving.

_Glaze._--Glaze is made by boiling down good stock until it is of a
very thick and gluey consistency. Put a quart of rich stock into a
sauce-pan over a good fire. Leave it uncovered, and boil it until it is
reduced to half a pint. Let it cool. Put it in a jar or bottle. Cover
closely, and keep in a cool place. This will keep for two or three
weeks.

_Adding vegetables and meat to soups._--Whenever vegetables or meats
have to be passed through a sieve or tammy, it will be found easier to
do so if the pulp is kept continually well moistened with stock or milk
(according to the soup which is being made).

_Wine and catsup._--Wine and catsup should always be added as late as
possible, as they lose in flavour by being boiled.

Cut all the vegetables into thin shreds of equal length (about one
inch). Use the red outer part of the carrots only, and the hearts of
the lettuce and cabbage. Wash the sorrel and cabbage separately, and
set aside. Put two ounces of butter and a salt-spoon of powdered sugar
in a sauce-pan, add to it all the vegetables except the cabbage and
sorrel. Let them turn a fine yellow, but be careful not to burn. Add
the consommé. Bring to the boil. Drain. Season. Set back to simmer
until the vegetables are tender. Then add the cabbage and sorrel, a
leaf of tarragon and chervil. Simmer another ten minutes and serve.

Macaroni Soup

1 quart stock

a quart of consommé or chicken stock. Bring it to the boil. Simmer for
half-an-hour. Stamp the sorrel and lettuce into small round pieces. Add
them, with a leaf of chervil and of tarragon and a tea-spoon of sugar,
to the soup. When all the vegetables are tender add a quarter of a pint
of young peas and the same quantity of asparagus heads both freshly
cooked. Serve with croûtons (see p. 103).

A large bouquet of parsley, thyme, bay-leaf, sweet basil and marjoram
8 cloves
2 blades of mace
¹⁄₂ pint sherry
Tea-spoonful lemon juice
White roux

Scald a calf’s head. Bone it. (Do this by making a sharp incision down
to the bone from the back of the head to the nose and peeling back the
flesh on each side with a knife.) Put the head in a sauce-pan. Cover it
with cold water. Boil it for quarter of an hour, skimming from time to
time. Then take it out and put it in a basin full of cold water.

Butter the bottom of a large stock-pot. Put in it an old fowl partly
roasted (of which the breast is kept back for forcemeat balls), a
knuckle of veal, the ham, and two quarts of good stock. Boil quickly
until the stock is reduced to one pint. Set back to simmer gently for
half-an-hour. Fill up the stock-pot with water.

Take the head out of the water. Pare away any rough parts in the mouth.
Put in the stock-pot. Bring to the boil. Skim thoroughly. Add the
vegetables, spices and bouquet. Simmer gently until the head is tender.
Remove the head. Strain the broth. When the meat is cool cut it up into
small squares (reserving a little for forcemeat balls).

Thicken the stock with light-coloured roux (p. 12). Let it boil up.
Skim off the butter that comes to the surface. Add half a pint of
sherry. Season with cayenne. Add a tea-spoonful of lemon juice, and

until the meat is tender, stirring from time to time. Strain off the
stock. Cut the meat from the bones, and set aside to cool.

Fry three onions, a carrot, and a head of celery (all finely sliced)
very slowly in a quarter of a pound of butter until they are a rich
golden brown. Add two table-spoons of flour. Stir in till smooth. Add
a table-spoon of curry powder, and the same quantity of curry paste.
Season with cayenne and salt. Add the vegetables to the stock, and add
more veal stock if required. Let it boil up. Skim. Simmer half-an-hour
very gently. Put through a tammy. Pour over the meat of the chickens or
rabbits (which should be cut into neat pieces). Heat gently, and simmer
for another ten minutes. If desired half a pint of scalded cream can be
added just before serving. Serve with plain boiled Patna rice (see p.
106).

When passing vegetables or meat through a tammy or fine sieve, it will
be easier if they are kept continually moistened with a little of the
stock or milk with which the purée is to be made.

Purées having been passed through the sieve or tammy, can, if not
required at once, be set aside until wanted. But a purée that has
reached this point must on no account be re-heated or have milk
or cream added to it until just before it is to be served. When
re-heating, if a meat purée, it should not be allowed to boil, or even
be made hotter than is absolutely necessary.

Allow all vegetable purées to boil up quickly for several minutes after
the purée and stock have been mixed. This will clarify them. All scum
should be carefully removed. When this is done, the butter and milk or
cream can be added.

A little white or brown roux well mixed with purées a minute or two
before serving will prevent the actual purée from separating from the
stock.

stock. Season. Boil gently for ten minutes. Put through a tammy. Heat

Purée of Fowl à la Reine 73

” ” à la Reine Margot 73

” Hare 74

” Pheasant 75

” Rabbit 75

Whenever a piece of meat or fowl is added to a soup, it must be added
as late as possible, and the soup must not be allowed to boil after
it has been added, or even made very hot. If it boils the purée will
curdle. Should it by accident do so, it is possible to remedy it by
adding a little more stock to the soup, putting it all through a tammy
again, and then warming it gently.

Purée of Fowl à la Reine

1 large tender fowl
¹⁄₄ lb. boiled rice
1¹⁄₂ pints water
¹⁄₂ pint cream

Roast the fowl. Cut off all the meat from it. Chop it and pound it.
Break the bones and carcase of the fowl. Put them and the skin in a
sauce-pan with the water. Bring to a boil and simmer for an hour or
two. Skim and strain. Add it to the pounded meat. Pass through a tammy.
Add the scalded cream. Season.

Purée of Fowl à la Reine Margot

1 fowl
1 quart water
¹⁄₂ pint cream
3 ozs. pounded almonds
1 tea-cup bread crumbs

Boil the fowl in a quart of water. When the fowl is tender, take it out
and set it aside. Skim the broth and pour it into a basin. Cut all the
meat off the fowl. Chop it very fine and pound it. Add to it the bread
crumbs (which must be very finely grated), and the pounded almonds.
Put all through a tammy and add to the broth. Season. Add the boiling
cream. The yolks of three eggs can also be added if desired (see p. 50).

Purée of Hare

1 small hare
1 quart water or consommé
1 small bouquet of herbs
2 ozs. butter
2 ozs. boiled rice
¹⁄₂ pint Sauterne

Skin and clean the hare. Cut it up into small pieces. Melt the butter
in a large sauce-pan. Add the pieces of hare to it with a small bouquet
of herbs. Fry them a good brown colour. Add the water or stock. Bring
to the boil. Simmer an hour-and-a-half. Strain off the broth. Cut off
all the meat from the hare. Chop and pound it. Add the rice. Dilute
with the broth and pass through a tammy. Heat the purée gently when
required, adding the Sauterne. Season. Serve with fried croûtons.

Purée of Pheasants

1 pheasant
1 quart stock
3 ozs. boiled rice
1 table-spoon glaze

Roast the pheasant until it is thoroughly done. Cut off all the meat.
Set aside the white meat. Put the rest with the bones and stock into a
sauce-pan. Bring to the boil and simmer for an hour. Chop and pound the
meat. Add the rice to it. Dilute with the strained stock. Pass through
a tammy. Add the table-spoonful of glaze (see p. 14). Serve with
croûtons.

Purée of Rabbit

1 rabbit
1¹⁄₂ pints water
2 ozs. barley or rice (well boiled)
¹⁄₂ pint cream
1 table-spoon brown roux

Roast the rabbit, seasoning it with salt, pepper and nutmeg. When it
is done, cut off all the meat. Put the bones with the water to make a
stock and simmer an hour or two. Skim and strain. Chop the meat and
pound it. When the stock is ready, put it with the meat and barley or
rice through a tammy. When ready to serve, heat the purée gently, and
add the roux (see p. 12). Season, and add half a pint of scalded cream.
Quenelles of rabbit may be served with this purée (see p. 105).

up the meat into very fine shreds and fry them for five minutes in the
butter, with the chopped celery and pepper and salt. Add the stock and
boil for half-an-hour. Drain off the stock. Pound the meat and pass it
through a tammy. When required, return the stock and purée to the fire.
Heat gently and stir continually, stir in the coral which should have
been rubbed through a very fine sieve when dry. Season and add a few
drops of lemon juice, the scalded cream or half a pint of hot white
wine. Do not allow the bisque to boil.

Oyster Bisque

stock, and a pint of milk. Boil for ten minutes, stirring continually.
Rub through a tammy. Return to the fire. Add a gill of boiling cream
and an ounce of butter in small pieces. Stir the bisque until it is
melted, but do not allow it to boil. Season. Serve with croûtons (see

2 onions
2 table-spoons of olive oil
¹⁄₂ a lemon
2 small tomatoes
1 glass white wine
1 laurel leaf
4 pepper corns
1 table-spoon chopped parsley
Bread

Wash the fish and cut it across in slices of different sizes. Take a
large iron sauce-pan, fry the onions with olive oil in it. When they
are coloured a good brown add the fish to the sauce-pan and just cover
it with warm water. Add also a laurel leaf, the inside of half a lemon
(from which the pips have been removed), two small tomatoes (peeled and
the seeds taken out) cut in dice and a glass of light white wine, the
pepper-corns and salt. Make up a big fire. Set the sauce-pan on it and
let the contents boil violently for twelve to fifteen minutes. Then add
a table-spoon of chopped parsley. Let it continue boiling for a minute.

In a warmed soup tureen put a number of slices of roll or bread. Pour
the liquid over them. See that they become thoroughly soaked with it.
Add the best of the fish and serve.

The best fish to use for Bouillabaisse are cod, whiting, mullet, sole,
turbot and langouste. It is absolutely essential that all the fish used
should be perfectly fresh.

In France 4 cloves of garlic would be added with the tomatoes, but this
is optional.

Fish Soup

1 lb. cod or halibut
1 quart milk
1 sliced onion
1 table-spoon white roux

Cook the fish in boiling salted water until it flakes easily. Drain it.

the fish. Season.

Oyster Soup

1 pint oysters
¹⁄₂ pint water
1 pint milk
1 gill thick cream
1 table-spoon white roux

Cover the oysters with the cold water. After a little while remove
them. Strain the liquor. Put it on to boil and skim. When clear add the
oysters. Let them simmer until their edges ruffle and their bodies grow
plump. (This should take about five minutes.) Take out the oysters,
set them where they will keep warm. Add the liquor to the milk, which
should be boiling. Add the roux (see p. 12) and seasoning. Simmer five
minutes. Add the boiling cream. Add the oysters.

Salmon Soup

¹⁄₂ lb. salmon
1 quart white stock
2 anchovies
¹⁄₂ head of celery
A piece of parsley
1 clove

Let half a pound of the salmon stew gently with the chopped anchovies,
in two ounces of butter, for twenty minutes, being very careful that
it does not brown. Add the stock, the celery, cut fine, parsley, spice
and herbs. Bring to the boil. Add the white roux (p. 12). Simmer for
an hour-and-a-half. Put through a tammy. Return to the fire. Add the

It is essential in making invalid soups that the meat used should be
uncooked and very good.

For beef tea use steak or shin of beef.

Every piece of skin, membrane and fat should be carefully removed from
the meat to be used.

Vegetables, spice and seasoning should not be used unless permitted by
the doctor.

When soup has to be made quickly a little time can be saved by removing
the fat from it while it is still hot (see p. 3).

Beef Essence

Cut up a lean piece of juicy rump steak into small pieces. Put these
into a closely covered jar without any water. Stand the jar in a large
sauce-pan containing cold water. Heat slowly and keep just below
boiling point. When the meat in the jar is white, it is done. This
should be in about two hours. Strain off the juice, pressing the meat
while doing so in order that none may be left in it. Season with a
little salt.

OR,

Place the meat in a closely covered jar in a moderate oven, leaving it
there for three hours. Strain as above.

In both cases the essence should be kept in a cold place. It must not
be boiled when it is heated. It can be made into beef tea by adding
boiling water to it.

Beef Tea--I

1 lb. very juicy rump steak or shin of beef
1 cup cold water

Cut the meat into very small pieces. Put these in a bowl and cover
with a cup of cold water. Cover the basin and leave for three or four
hours. Then, squeezing the meat firmly, drain off all the liquid.
Strain this, add a little salt, and when required heat very gently. It
is best to do this in a _bain marie_, as it curdles easily (see p. 110).

Add another cup of cold water to the meat, and proceed as for the first
cup.

Beef Tea--II

1 lb. steak or shin of beef
2 pints water

Cut the meat, which must be lean and juicy, into small pieces. Put them
into a stew-pan and cover with a quart of water. Heat very gently.
Skim whenever necessary. Simmer for a little more than an hour. Strain
through muslin into a basin. Let it stand until cool. Remove the fat.
Pour off the clear beef tea very gently from the dregs.

Beef Tea--III

4 lbs. of steak or shin of beef
2 lbs. bones
2 quarts cold water

Break and crush the bones. Cut the meat into small pieces. Put into a
stew-pan and cover with the cold water. Heat very slowly. Simmer for
three hours. Add a little salt. Strain into a basin. Allow it to cool.
Remove any fat very carefully. Pour off the clear liquid carefully from
the dregs.

If allowed, a little carrot and celery may be cooked with the beef tea.

Calves’ Foot Broth (or Jelly)

2 calves’ feet
2 quarts cold water
2 table-spoons sugar
Juice of half a lemon
Glass of good white wine

Scald and clean the feet. Split and break them. Put into a stew-pan and
cover with two quarts of cold water. Heat very slowly and simmer until
reduced to about a pint and a half. Strain. When cold remove the fat.
Add sugar and lemon juice. Return to the fire. Let it boil for five
minutes, stirring continually. Skim thoroughly. Add the wine. Strain
through a jelly bag, and keep in a cold place.

In making broth, the wine may be omitted, and in its place the beaten
yolk of an egg added. In which case it will only be necessary to strain
it instead of passing it through a jelly bag. Sago or tapioca, which
has been boiled till tender, should be added.

Chicken Broth

One chicken
1 quart of cold water
Juice of a lemon
Boiled rice or vermicelli

Cut up a chicken into small pieces. Remove the meat from the bones
as much as possible. Crush the bones. Cover meat and bones with a
quart of water. Heat very slowly. Simmer until perfectly tender. When
tender strain off the liquid. Let it get cool. Remove the fat. Heat
again, adding a little salt and a few drops of lemon juice. Allow the
broth to boil for five minutes. Strain through a napkin. Add a little
well boiled rice or vermicelli, and a little of the white meat of the
chicken cut in dice.

Chicken Custard

1 chicken
3 pints of cold water
2 yolks of eggs

Clean, skin and cut up a young chicken. Put it into a stew-pan with
about three pints of cold water. Heat very slowly. Skim carefully when
it boils. Allow it to simmer for an hour. Strain off the liquid through
a napkin.

To each half pint of broth add the yolks of two eggs. Put in a double
boiler and stir until it thickens (see p. 50). Serve at once.

Chicken Panada

1 chicken
1 French roll
1 quart cold water

Skin a chicken and boil it gently until tender. Remove it from the
liquid and let it cool. Then cut off the white meat, pound it in a
mortar. Mix with it the crumb of a French roll that has been soaked
in broth. Add a little of the broth the chicken was boiled in. Pass
through a tammy. Dilute with broth. Salt. Heat gently, but do not allow
it to boil.

A table-spoon of well-boiled rice may be substituted for the crumb of a
French roll.

Game Panada

Game panada is made in exactly the same way as chicken panada,
substituting a pheasant, or a couple of partridges, for the chicken.

Chicken Tea

1 chicken
1 quart cold water

Skin a chicken and divide it into pieces. Put in a stew-pan and cover
with one quart of water. Simmer gently for a full hour. Strain. Allow
it to cool. Remove the fat. Serve hot or cold.

Mutton Broth

1 lb. lean mutton
1 pint cold water
2 table-spoons boiled rice

Chop the mutton very fine. Put it in a stew-pan with one pint of cold
water. Put it in a basin and cover it with the water. Cover the basin.
Let it stand for an hour. Then heat very gently. Simmer for quarter of
an hour. Strain. Remove the fat. Add the well-boiled rice.

Veal Broth

A knuckle of veal
A chicken
2 quarts of water
2 table-spoons well-boiled rice

Put a knuckle of veal and a chicken (an old one will do) into a large
stew-pan. Cover with two quarts of water. Let it boil up gently. Skim.
Simmer for three hours. Strain through a napkin. Allow it to cool.
Remove the fat. Serve with a little boiled rice.

in a little flour, then in the egg. Fry in very hot lard till a rich
yellow.

Sauces

There is, of course, no end to sauces, and in a book of this size it is
impossible to do justice to their variety. Enough are, however, I hope,
given in the pages that follow for ordinary needs.

It is of the highest importance in making sauces that the materials
used should be of the best. Fresh butter and the finest olive oil
should be used.

When adding the yolks of eggs to sauces it is best to do so in a _bain
marie_ (_i.e._ to stand the sauce-pan in which the sauce is being made,
inside a larger one full of boiling water), as they must never be
allowed to boil, and a quick fire easily burns them.

For thickening sauces, etc., see remarks on soup on p. 12.
